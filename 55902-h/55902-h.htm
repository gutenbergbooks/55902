    <h2>
      MILL ON GOVERNMENT.(1)
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, March 1829.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>f <span
      class="pagenum">5</span><a name="link5" id="link5"></a>those philosophers
      who call themselves Utilitarians, and whom others generally call
      Benthamites, Mr. Mill is, with the exception of the illustrious founder of
      the sect, by far the most distinguished. The little work now before us
      contains a summary of the opinions held by this gentleman and his brethren
      on several subjects most important to society. All the seven essays of
      which it consists abound in curious matter. But at present we intend to
      confine our remarks to the Treatise on Government, which stands first in
      the volume. On some future occasion, we may perhaps attempt to do justice
      to the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be owned that to do justice to any composition of Mr. Mill is not,
      in the opinion of his admirers, a very easy task. They do not, indeed,
      place him in the same rank with Mr. Bentham; but the terms in which they
      extol the disciple, though feeble when compared with the hyperboles of
      adoration employed by
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) <i>Essays on Government, Jurisprudence, the Liberty of the
     Press, Prisons and Prison Discipline, Colonies, the Law of
     Nations, and Education</i>, By James Mill, Esq., author of the
     History of British India. Reprinted by permission from the
     Supplement to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. (Not for sale.)
     London, 1828.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">6</span><a name="link6" id="link6"></a>them in
      speaking of the master, are as strong as any sober man would allow himself
      to use concerning Locke or Bacon. The essay before us is perhaps the most
      remarkable of the works to which Mr. Mill owes his fame. By the members of
      his sect, it is considered as perfect and unanswerable. Every part of it
      is an article of their faith; and the damnatory clauses, in which their
      creed abounds far beyond any theological symbol with which we are
      acquainted, are strong and full against all who reject any portion of what
      is so irrefragably established. No man, they maintain, who has
      understanding sufficient to carry him through the first proposition of
      Euclid, can read this master-piece of demonstration and honestly declare
      that he remains unconvinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have formed a very different opinion of this work. We think that the
      theory of Mr. Mill rests altogether on false principles, and that even on
      those false principles he does not reason logically. Nevertheless, we do
      not think it strange that his speculations should have filled the
      Utilitarians with admiration. We have been for some time past inclined to
      suspect that these people, whom some regard as the lights of the world and
      others as incarnate demons, are in general ordinary men, with narrow
      understandings and little information. The contempt which they express for
      elegant literature is evidently the contempt of ignorance. We apprehend
      that many of them are persons who, having read little or nothing, are
      delighted to be rescued from the sense of their own inferiority by some
      teacher who assures them that the studies which they have neglected are of
      no value, puts five or six phrases into their mouths, lends them an odd
      number of the Westminster Review, and in a month <span class="pagenum">7</span><a
      name="link7" id="link7"></a>transforms them into philosophers. Mingled
      with these smatterers, whose attainments just suffice to elevate them from
      the insignificance of dunces to the dignity of bores, and to spread dismay
      among their pious aunts and grandmothers, there are, we well know, many
      well-meaning men who have really read and thought much; but whose reading
      and meditation have been almost exclusively confined to one class of
      subjects; and who, consequently, though they possess much valuable
      knowledge respecting those subjects, are by no means so well qualified to
      judge of a great system as if they had taken a more enlarged view of
      literature and society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing is more amusing or instructive than to observe the manner in which
      people who think themselves wiser than all the rest of the world fall into
      snares which the simple good sense of their neighbours detects and avoids.
      It is one of the principal tenets of the Utilitarians that sentiment and
      eloquence serve only to impede the pursuit of truth. They therefore affect
      a quakerly plainness, or rather a cynical negligence and impurity, of
      style. The strongest arguments, when clothed in brilliant language, seem
      to them so much wordy nonsense. In the mean time they surrender their
      understandings, with a facility found in no other party, to the meanest
      and most abject sophisms, provided those sophisms come before them
      disguised with the externals of demonstration. They do not seem to know
      that logic has its illusions as well as rhetoric,&mdash;that a fallacy may
      lurk in a syllogism as well as in a metaphor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mill is exactly the writer to please people of this description. His
      arguments are stated with the utmost affectation of precision; his
      divisions are awfully <span class="pagenum">8</span><a
      name="link8_rdquo_________id_" id="link8_rdquo_________id_"></a>formal;
      and his style is generally as dry as that of Euclid&rsquo;s Elements.
      Whether this be a merit, we must be permitted to doubt. Thus much is
      certain: that the ages in which the true principles of philosophy were
      least understood were those in which the ceremonial of logic was most
      strictly observed, and that the time from which we date the rapid progress
      of the experimental sciences was also the time at which a less exact and
      formal way of writing came into use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The style which the Utilitarians admire suits only those subjects on which
      it is possible to reason <i>a priori</i> It grew up with the verbal
      sophistry which flourished during the dark ages. With that sophistry it
      fell before the Baconian philosophy in the day of the great deliverance of
      the human mind. The inductive method not only endured but required greater
      freedom of diction. It was impossible to reason from phenomena up to
      principles, to mark slight shades of difference in quality, or to estimate
      the comparative effect of two opposite considerations between which there
      was no common measure, by means of the naked and meagre jargon of the
      schoolmen. Of those schoolmen Mr. Mill has inherited both the spirit and
      the style. He is an Aristotelian of the fifteenth century, born out of due
      season. We have here an elaborate treatise on Government, from which, but
      for two or three passing allusions, it would not appear that the author
      was aware that any governments actually existed among men. Certain
      propensities of human nature are assumed; and from these premises the
      whole science of politics is synthetically deduced! We can scarcely
      persuade ourselves that we are not reading a book written before the time
      of Bacon and Galileo,&mdash;a book <span class="pagenum">9</span><a
      name="link9" id="link9"></a>written in those days in which physicians
      reasoned from the nature of heat to the treatment of fever, and
      astronomers proved syllogistically that the planets could have no
      independent motion,&mdash;because the heavens were incorruptible, and
      nature abhorred a vacuum!
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason, too, which Mr. Mill has assigned for taking this course
      strikes us as most extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Experience,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;if we look only at the outside
      of the facts, appears to be <i>divided</i> on this subject. Absolute
      monarchy, under Neros and Caligulas, under such men as the Emperors of
      Morocco and Sultans of Turkey, is the scourge of human nature. On the
      other side, the people of Denmark, tired out with the oppression of an
      aristocracy, resolved that their king should be absolute; and, under their
      absolute monarch, are as well governed as any people in Europe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This Mr. Mill actually gives as a reason for pursuing the <i>a priori</i>
      method. But, in our judgment, the very circumstances which he mentions
      irresistibly prove that the <i>a priori</i> method is altogether unfit for
      investigations of this kind, and that the only way to arrive at the truth
      is by induction. <i>Experience</i> can never be divided, or even appear to
      be divided, except with reference to some hypothesis. When we say that one
      fact is inconsistent with another fact, we mean only that it is
      inconsistent with <i>the theory</i> which we have founded on that other
      fact. But, if the fact be certain, the unavoidable conclusion is that our
      theory is false; and, in order to correct it, we must reason back from an
      enlarged collection of facts to principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now here we have two governments which, by Mr. Mill&rsquo;s own account,
      come under the same head in his <i>theoretical</i> classification. It is
      evident, therefore, that, <span class="pagenum">10</span><a
      name="link10_rdquo_________id_" id="link10_rdquo_________id_"></a>by
      reasoning on that theoretical classification, we shall be brought to the
      conclusion that these two forms of government must produce the same
      effects. But Mr. Mill himself tells us that they do not produce the same
      effects. Hence he infers that the only way to get at truth is to place
      implicit confidence in that chain of proof <i>a priori</i> from which it
      appears that they must produce the same effects! To believe at once in a
      theory and in a fact which contradicts it is an exercise of faith
      sufficiently hard: but to believe in a theory <i>because</i> a fact
      contradicts it is what neither philosopher nor pope ever before required.
      This, however, is what Mr. Mill demands of us. He seems to think that, if
      all despots, without exception, governed ill, it would be unnecessary to
      prove, by a synthetical argument, what would then be sufficiently clear
      from experience. But, as some despots will be so perverse as to govern
      well, he finds himself compelled to prove the impossibility of their
      governing well by that synthetical argument which would have been
      superfluous had not the facts contradicted it. He reasons <i>a priori</i>,
      because the phenomena are not what, by reasoning <i>a priori</i>, he will
      prove them to be. In other words, he reasons <i>a priori</i>, because, by
      so reasoning, he is certain to arrive at a false conclusion!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the examination to which we propose to subject the
      speculations of Mr. Mill we shall have to notice many other curious
      instances of that turn of mind which the passage above quoted indicates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first chapter of his Essay relates to the ends of government. The
      conception on this subject, he tells us, which exists in the minds of most
      men is vague and undistinguishing. He first assumes, justly enough, that
      the end of government is &ldquo;to increase to the utmost <span
      class="pagenum">11</span><a name="link11" id="link11"></a>the pleasures,
      and diminish to the utmost the pains, which men derive from each other.&rdquo;
      He then proceeds to show, with great form, that &ldquo;the greatest
      possible happiness of society is attained by insuring to every man the
      greatest possible quantity of the produce of his labour.&rdquo; To effect
      this is, in his opinion, the end of government. It is remarkable that Mr.
      Mill, with all his affected display of precision, has here given a
      description of the ends of government far less precise than that which is
      in the mouths of the vulgar. The first man with whom Mr. Mill may travel
      in a stage coach will tell him that government exists for the protection
      of the <i>persons</i> and property of men. But Mr. Mill seems to think
      that the preservation of property is the first and only object. It is
      true, doubtless, that many of the injuries which are offered to the
      persons of men proceed from a desire to possess their property. But the
      practice of vindictive assassination as it has existed in some parts of
      Europe&mdash;the practice of fighting wanton and sanguinary duels, like
      those of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in which bands of
      seconds risked their lives as well as the principals;&mdash;these
      practices, and many others which might be named, are evidently injurious
      to society; and we do not see how a government which tolerated them could
      be said &ldquo;to diminish to the utmost the pains which men derive from
      each other.&rdquo; Therefore, according to Mr. Mill&rsquo;s very correct
      assumption, such a government would not perfectly accomplish the end of
      its institution. Yet such a government might, as far as we can perceive,
      &ldquo;insure to every man the greatest possible quantity of the produce
      of his labour.&rdquo; Therefore such a government might, according to Mr.
      Milks subsequent doctrine, perfectly accomplish the end of its
      institution. <span class="pagenum">12</span><a name="link12" id="link12"></a>The
      matter is not of much consequence, except as an instance of that
      slovenliness of thinking which is often concealed beneath a peculiar
      ostentation of logical neatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having determined the ends, Mr. Mill proceeds to consider the means. For
      the preservation of property-some portion of the community must be
      intrusted with power. This is Government; and the question is, how are
      those to whom the necessary power is intrusted to be prevented from
      abusing it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mill first passes in review the simple forms of government. He allows
      that it would be inconvenient, if not physically impossible, that the
      whole community should meet in a mass; it follows, therefore, that the
      powers of government cannot be directly exercised by the people. But he
      sees no objection to pure and direct Democracy, except the difficulty
      which we have mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The community,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;cannot have an interest
      opposite to its interests. To affirm this would be a contradiction in
      terms. The community within itself, and with respect to itself, can have
      no sinister interest. One community may intend the evil of another; never
      its own. This is an indubitable proposition, and one of great importance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mill then proceeds to demonstrate that a purely aristocratical form of
      government is necessarily bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The reason for which government exists is, that one man, if
      stronger than another, will take from him whatever that other possesses
      and he desires. But if one man will do this, so will several. And if
      powers are put into the hands of a comparatively small number, called an
      aristocracy,&mdash;powers which make them stronger than the rest of the
      community, they will take from the rest of the community as much as they
      please of the objects <span class="pagenum">13</span><a name="link13"
      id="link13"></a>of desire. They will thus defeat the very end for whieh
      government was instituted. The unfitness, therefore, of an aristocracy to
      be intrusted with the powers of government, rests on demonstration</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In exactly the same manner Mr. Mill proves absolute monarchy to be a bad
      form of government.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>If government is founded upon this as a law of human nature,
      that a man, if able, will take from others any thing which they have and
      he desires, it is sufficiently evident, that when a man is called a king
      he does not change his nature; so that when he has got power to enable him
      to take from every man whatever he pleases, he will take whatever he
      pleases. To suppose that he will not, is to affirm that government is
      unnecessary, and that human beings will abstain from injuring one another
      of their own accord. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very evident that this reasoning extends to every
      modification of the smaller number. Whenever the powers of government are
      placed in any hands other than those of the community, whether those of
      one man, of a few, or of several, those principles of human nature which
      imply that government is at all necessary, imply that those persons will
      make use of them to defeat the very end for which government exists.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But is it not possible that a king or an aristocracy may soon be saturated
      with the objects of their desires, and may then protect the community in
      the enjoyment of the rest? Mr. Mill answers in the negative. He proves,
      with great pomp, that every man desires to have the actions of every other
      correspondent to his will. Others can be induced to conform to our will
      only by motives derived from pleasure or from pain. The infliction of pain
      is of course direct injury; and, even if it take the milder course, in
      order to produce obedience by motives derived from pleasure, the
      government must confer favours. But, as there is no limit to its desire of
      obedience, there will be no limit to its disposition to confer favours;
      and, as it can confer favours <span class="pagenum">14</span><a
      name="link14" id="link14"></a>only by plundering the people, there will be
      no limit to its disposition to plunder the people. &ldquo;It is therefore
      not true that there is in the mind of a king, or in the minds of an
      aristocracy, any point of saturation with the objects of desire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mill then proceeds to show that, as monarchical and oligarchical
      governments can influence men by motives drawn from pain, as well as by
      motives drawn from pleasure, they will carry their cruelty, as well as
      their rapacity, to a frightful extent. As he seems greatly to admire his
      own reasonings on this subject, we think it but fair to let him speak for
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The chain of inference in this ease is close and strong to a
      most unusual degree. A man desires that the actions of other men shall be
      instantly and accurately correspondent to his will. He desires that the
      actions of the greatest possible number shall be so. Terror is the grand
      instrument. Terror can work only through assurance that evil will follow
      any failure of conformity between the will and the actions willed. Every
      failure must therefore be punished. As there are no bounds to the mind&rsquo;s
      desire of its pleasure, there are, of course, no bounds to its desire of
      perfection in the instruments of that pleasure. There are, therefore, no
      bounds to its desire of exactness in the conformity between its will and
      the actions willed; and by consequence to the strength of that terror
      which is its procuring cause. Every the most minute failure must be
      visited with the heaviest infliction; and as failure in extreme exactness
      must frequently happen, the occasions of cruelty must be incessant. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have thus arrived at several conclusions of the highest possible
      importance. We have seen that the principle of human nature, upon which
      the necessity of government is founded, the propensity of one man to
      possess himself of the objects of desire at the cost of another, leads on,
      by infallible sequence, where power over a community is attained, and
      nothing checks, not only to that degree of plunder which leaves the
      members (excepting always the recipients and instruments of the plunder)
      the bare means of subsistence, but to that degree of cruelty which is
      necessary to keep in existence the most intense terrors.&rdquo; <span
      class="pagenum">15</span><a name="link15" id="link15"></a>Now, no man who
      has the least knowledge of the real state of the world, either in former
      ages or at the present moment, can possibly be convinced, though he may
      perhaps be bewildered, by arguments like these.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last two centuries, some hundreds of absolute princes have
      reigned in Europe Is it true, that their cruelty has kept in existence the
      most intense degree of terror; that their rapacity has left no more than
      the bare means of subsistence to any of their subjects, their ministers
      and soldiers excepted? Is this true of all of them? Of one half of them?
      Of one tenth part of them? Of a single one? Is it true, in the full
      extent, even of Philip the Second, of Louis the Fifteenth, or of the
      Emperor Paul? But it is scarcely necessary to quote history. No man of
      common sense, however ignorant he may be of books, can be imposed on by
      Mr. Mill&rsquo;s argument I because no man of common sense can live among
      his fellow-creatures for a day without seeing innumerable facts which
      contradict it. It is our business, however, to point out its fallacy; and
      happily the fallacy is not very recondite.
    </p>
    <p>
      We grant that rulers will take as much as they can of the objects of their
      desires; and that, when the agency of other men is necessary to that end,
      they will attempt by all means in their power to enforce the prompt
      obedience of such men. But what are the objects of human desire? Physical
      pleasure, no doubt, in part. But the mere appetites which we have in
      common with the animals would be gratified almost as cheaply and easily as
      those of the animals are gratified, if nothing were given to taste, to
      ostentation, or to the affections. How small a portion of the income of a
      gentleman in easy circumstances is laid out merely in <span class="pagenum">16</span><a
      name="link16" id="link16"></a>giving pleasurable sensations to the body of
      the possessor! The greater part even of what is spent on his kitchen and
      his cellar goes, not to titillate his palate, but to keep up his character
      for hospitality, to save him from the reproach of meanness in
      housekeeping, and to cement the ties of good neighbourhood. It is clear
      that a king or an aristocracy may be supplied to satiety with mere
      corporal pleasures, at an expense which the rudest and poorest community
      would scarcely feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those tastes and propensities which belong to us as reasoning and
      imaginative beings are not indeed so easily gratified. There is, we admit,
      no point of saturation with objects of desire which come under this head.
      And therefore the argument of Mr. Mill will be just, unless there be
      something in the nature of the objects of desire themselves which is
      inconsistent with it. Now, of these objects there is none which men in
      general seem to desire more than the good opinion of others. The hatred
      and contempt of the public are generally felt to be intolerable. It is
      probable that our regard for the sentiments of our fellow-creatures
      springs, by association, from a sense of their ability to hurt or to serve
      us. But, be this as it may, it is notorious that, when the habit of mind
      of which we speak has once been formed, men feel extremely solicitous
      about the opinions of those by whom it is most improbable, nay, absolutely
      impossible, that they should ever be in the slightest degree injured or
      benefited. The desire of posthumous fame and the dread of posthumous
      reproach and execration are feelings from the influence of which scarcely
      any man is perfectly free, and which in many men are powerful and constant
      motives of action. As we are afraid that, if we handle this part of the
      argument after our own manner, we <span class="pagenum">17</span><a
      name="link17" id="link17"></a>shall incur the reproach of sentimentality,
      a word which, in the sacred language of the Benthamites, is synonymous
      with idiocy, we will quote what Mr. Mill himself says on the subject, in
      his Treatise on Jurisprudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pains from the moral source are the pains derived from the
      unfavourable sentiments of mankind.... These pains are capable of rising
      to a height with which hardly any other pains incident to our nature can
      be compared. There is a certain degree of unfavourableness in the
      sentiments of his fellow-creatures, under which hardly any man, not below
      the standard of humanity, can endure to live. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The importance of this powerful agency, for the prevention of
      injurious acts, is too obvious to need to be illustrated. If sufficiently
      at command, it would almost supersede the use of other means....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To know how to direct the unfavourable sentiments of mankind, it is
      necessary to know in as complete, that is, in as comprehensive, a way as
      possible, what it is which gives them birth. Without entering into the
      metaphysics of the question, it is a sufficient practical answer, for the
      present purpose, to say that the unfavourable sentiments of man are
      excited by every thing which hurts them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is strange that a writer who considers the pain derived from the
      unfavourable sentiments of others as so acute that, if sufficiently at
      command, it would supersede the use of the gallows and the tread-mill,
      should take no notice of this most important restraint when discussing the
      question of government. We will attempt to deduce a theory of politics in
      the mathematical form, in which Mr. Mill delights, from the premises with
      which he has himself furnished us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proposition I. Theorem.
    </p>
    <p>
      No rulers will do any thing which may hurt the people. <span
      class="pagenum">18</span><a name="link18" id="link18"></a>This is the
      thesis to be maintained: and the following we humbly offer to Mr. Mill, as
      its syllogistic demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      No rulers will do that which produces pain to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the unfavourable sentiments of the people will give pain to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore no rulers will do any thing which may excite the unfavourable
      sentiments of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the unfavourable sentiments of the people are excited by every thing
      which hurts them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore no rulers will do any thing which may hurt the people. Which was
      the thing to be proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus, as we think, not unsuccessfully imitated Mr. Mill&rsquo;s
      logic, we do not see why we should not imitate, what is at least equally
      perfect in its kind, his self-complacency, and proclaim our <i>Evonka</i>
      in his own words: &ldquo;The chain of inference, in this case, is close
      and strong to a most unusual degree.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is, that, when men, in treating of things which cannot be
      circumscribed by precise definitions, adopt this mode of reasoning, when
      once they begin to talk of power, happiness, misery, pain, pleasure,
      motives, objects of desire, as they talk of lines and numbers, there is no
      end to the contradictions and absurdities into which they fall. There is
      no proposition so monstrously untrue in morals or politics that we will
      not undertake to prove it, by something which shall sound like a logical
      demonstration, from admitted principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mill argues that, if men are not inclined to plunder each other,
      government is unnecessary; and that, if they are so inclined, the powers
      of government, when entrusted to a small number of them, will necessarily
      <span class="pagenum">19</span><a name="link19" id="link19"></a>be abused.
      Surely it is not by propounding dilemmas of this sort that we are likely
      to arrive at sound conclusions in any moral science. The whole question is
      a question of degree. If all men preferred the moderate approbation of
      their neighbours to any degree of wealth or grandeur, or sensual pleasure,
      government would be unnecessary. If all men desired wealth so intensely as
      to be willing to brave the hatred of their fellow-creatures for sixpence,
      Mr. Mill&rsquo;s argument against monarchies and aristocracies would be
      true to the full extent. But the fact is, that all men have some desires
      which impel them to injure their neighbours, and some desires which impel
      them to benefit their neighbours. Now, if there were a community
      consisting of two classes of men, one of which should be principally
      influenced by the one set of motives and the other by the other,
      government would clearly be necessary to restrain the class which was
      eager for plunder and careless of reputation: and yet the powers of
      government might be safely intrusted to the class which was chiefly
      actuated by the love of approbation. Now, it might with no small
      plausibility be maintained that, in many countries, <i>there are</i> two
      classes which, in some degree, answer to this description; that the poor
      compose the class which government is established to restrain, and the
      people of some property the class to which the powers of government may
      without danger be confided. It might be said that a man who can barely
      earn a livelihood by severe labour is under stronger temptations to
      pillage others than a man who enjoys many luxuries. It might be said that
      a man who is lost in the crowd is less likely to have the fear of public
      opinion before his eyes than a man whose station and mode of living render
      him conspicuous. We do <span class="pagenum">20</span><a name="link20"
      id="link20"></a>not assert all this. We only say that it was Mr. Mill&rsquo;s
      business to prove the contrary; and that, not having proved the contrary,
      he is not entitled to say, &ldquo;that those principles which imply that
      government is at all necessary, imply that an aristocracy will make use of
      its power to defeat the end for which governments exist.&rdquo; This is
      not true, unless it be true that a rich man is as likely to covet the
      goods of his neighbours as a poor man, and that a poor man is as likely to
      be solicitous about the opinions of his neighbours as a rich man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we do not see that, by reasoning <i>a priori</i> on such subjects as
      these, it is possible to advance one single step. We know that every man
      has some desires which he can gratify only by hurting his neighbours, and
      some which he can gratify only by pleasing them. Mr. Mill has chosen to
      look only at one-half of human nature, and to reason on the motives which
      impel men to oppress and despoil others, as if they were the only motives
      by which men could possibly be influenced. We have already shown that, by
      taking the other half of the human character, and reasoning on it as if it
      were the whole, we can bring out a result diametrically opposite to that
      at which Mr. Mill has arrived. We can, by such a process, easily prove
      that any form of government is good, or that all government is
      superfluous.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must now accompany Mr. Mill on the next stage of his argument. Does any
      combination of the three simple forms of government afford the requisite
      securities against the abuse of power? Mr. Mill complains that those who
      maintain the affirmative generally beg the question; and proceeds to
      settle the point by proving, after his fashion, that no combination of the
      three simple forms, or of any two of them, can possibly exist. <span
      class="pagenum">21</span><a name="link21" id="link21"></a>&ldquo;<i>From
      the principles which we have already laid down it follows that, of the
      objects of human desire, and, speaking more definitely, of the means to
      the ends of human desire, namely, wealth and power, each party will
      endeavour to obtain as much as possible. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If any expedient presents itself to any of the supposed parties
      effectual to this end, and not opposed to any preferred object of pursuit,
      we may infer with certainty that it will be adopted. One effectual
      expedient is not more effectual than obvious. Any two of the parties, by
      combining, may swallow up the third. That such combination will take place
      appears to be as certain as any thing which depends upon human will;
      because there are strong motives in favour of it, and none that can be
      conceived in opposition to it.... The mixture of three of the kinds of
      government, it is thus evident, cannot possibly exist.... It may be proper
      to inquire whether an union may not be possible of two of them....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us first suppose, that monarchy is united with aristocracy.
      Their power is equal or not equal. If it is not equal, it follows, as a
      necessary consequence, from the principles which we have already
      established, that the stronger will take from the weaker till it engrosses
      the whole. The only question therefore is, What will happen when the power
      is equal?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, it seems impossible that such equality should
      ever exist. How is it to be established? or, by what criterion is it to be
      ascertained? If there is no such criterion, it must, in all eases, be the
      result of chance. If so, the chances against it are as infinity to one.
      The idea, therefore, is wholly chimerical and absurd....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this doctrine of the mixture of the simple forms of government
      is included the celebrated theory of the balance among the component parts
      of a government. By this it is supposed that, when a government is
      composed of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, they balance one
      another, and by mutual checks produce good government. A few words will
      suffice to show that, if any theory deserves the epithets of &lsquo;wild,
      visionary and chimerical,&rsquo; it is that of the balance. If there are
      three powers, how is it possible to prevent two of them from combining to
      swallow up the third?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The analysis which we have already performed will enable us to
      trace rapidly the concatenation of causes and effects in this imagined
      case. <span class="pagenum">22</span><a name="link22" id="link22"></a>"We
      have already seen that the interest of the community, considered in the
      aggregate or in the democratical point of view, is, that each individual
      should receive protection; and that the powers which are constituted for
      that purpose should be employed exclusively for that purpose.... We have
      also seen that the interest of the king and of the governing aristocracy
      is directly the reverse. It is to have unlimited power over the rest of
      the community, and to use it for their own advantage. In the supposed case
      of the balance of the monarchical, aristocratical, and democratical
      powers, it cannot be for the interest of either the monarchy or the
      aristocracy to combine with the democracy; because it is the interest of
      the democracy, or community at large, that neither the king nor the
      aristocracy should have one particle of power, or one particle of the
      wealth of the community, for their own advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The democracy or community have all possible motives to endeavour
      to prevent the monarchy and aristocracy from exercising power, or
      obtaining the wealth of the community for their own advantage. The
      monarchy and aristocracy have all possible motives for endeavouring to
      obtain unlimited power over the persons and property of the community. The
      consequence is inevitable: they have all possible, motives for combining
      to obtain that power.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If any part of this passage be more eminently absurd than another, it is,
      we think, the argument by which Mr. Mill proves that there cannot be an
      union of monarchy and aristocracy. Their power, he says, must be equal or
      not equal. But of equality there is no criterion. Therefore the chances
      against its existence are as infinity to one. If the power be not equal,
      then it follows, from the principles of human nature, that the stronger
      will take from the weaker, till it has engrossed the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if there be no criterion of equality between two portions of power
      there can be no common measure of portions of power. Therefore it is
      utterly impossible to compare them together. But where two <span
      class="pagenum">23</span><a name="link23" id="link23"></a>portions of
      lower are of the same kind, there is no difficulty in ascertaining,
      sufficiently for all practical purposes, whether they are equal or
      unequal. It is easy to judge whether two men run equally fast, or can lift
      equal weights. Two arbitrators, whose joint decision is to be final, and
      neither of whom can do any thing without the assent of the other, possess
      equal power. Two electors, each of whom has a vote for a borough, possess,
      in that respect, equal power. If not, all Mr. Mill&rsquo;s political
      theories fall to the ground at once. For, if it be impossible to ascertain
      whether two portions of power are equal, he never can show that, even
      under a system of universal suffrage, a minority might not carry every
      thing their own way, against the wishes and interests of the majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where there are two portions of power differing in kind, there is, we
      admit, no criterion of equality. But then, in such a case, it is absurd to
      talk, as Mr. Mill does, about the stronger and the weaker. Popularly,
      indeed, and with reference to some particular objects, these words may
      very fairly be used. But to use them mathematically is altogether
      improper. If we are speaking of a boxing-match, we may say that some
      famous bruiser has greater bodily power than any man in England. If we are
      speaking of a pantomime, we may say the same of some very agile harlequin.
      But it would be talking nonsense to say, in general, that the power of
      Harlequin either exceeded that of the pugilist, or fell short of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Mill&rsquo;s argument be good as between different branches of a
      legislature, it is equally good as between sovereign powers. Every
      government, it may be said, will, if it can, take the objects of its
      desires from every other. If the French government can subdue England
      <span class="pagenum">24</span><a name="link24" id="link24"></a>it will do
      so. If the English government can subdue France it will do so. But the
      power of England and France is either equal or not equal. The chance that
      it is not exactly equal is as infinity to one, and may safely be left out
      of the account; and then the stronger will infallibly take from the weaker
      till the weaker is altogether enslaved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely the answer to all this hubbub of unmeaning words is the plainest
      possible. For some purposes France is stronger than England. For some
      purposes England is stronger than France. For some, neither has any power
      at all. France has the greater population, England the greater capital;
      France has the greater army, England the greater fleet. For an expedition
      to Rio Janeiro or the Philippines, England has the greater power. For a
      war on the Po or the Danube, France has the greater power. But neither has
      power sufficient to keep the other in quiet subjection for a month.
      Invasion would be very perilous; the idea of complete conquest on either
      side utterly ridiculous. This is the manly and sensible way of discussing
      such questions. The <i>ergo</i>, or rather the <i>argal</i>, of Mr. Mill
      cannot impose on a child. Yet we ought scarcely to say this; for we
      remember to have heard <i>a child</i> ask whether Bonaparte was stronger
      than an elephant!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mill reminds us of those philosophers of the sixteenth century who,
      having satisfied themselves <i>a priori</i> that the rapidity with which
      bodies descended to the earth varied exactly as their weights, refused to
      believe the contrary on the evidence of their own eyes and ears. The
      British constitution, according to Mr. Mill&rsquo;s classification, is a
      mixture of monarchy and aristocracy; one House of Parliament being
      composed of <span class="pagenum">25</span><a name="link25" id="link25"></a>hereditary
      nobles, and the other almost entirely chosen by a privileged class who
      possess the elective franchise on account of their property, or their
      connection with certain corporations. Mr. Mill&rsquo;s argument proves
      that, from the time that these two powers were mingled in our government,
      that is, from the very first dawn of our history, one or the other must
      have been constantly encroaching. According to him, moreover, all the
      encroachments must have been on one side. For the first encroachment could
      only have been made by the stronger I and that first encroachment would
      have made the stronger stronger still. It is, therefore, matter of
      absolute demonstration, that either the Parliament was stronger than the
      Crown in the reign of Henry VIII., or that the Crown was stronger than the
      Parliament in 1641. &ldquo;Hippocrate dira ce que lui plaira,&rdquo; says
      the girl in Moliere; &ldquo;mail le cocher est mort.&rdquo; Mr. Mill may
      say what he pleases; but the English constitution is still alive. That
      since the Revolution the Parliament has possessed great power in the
      state, is what nobody will dispute. The King, on the other hand, can
      create new peers, and can dissolve Parliaments. William sustained severe
      mortifications from the House of Commons, and was, indeed, unjustifiably
      oppressed. Anne was desirous to change a ministry which had a majority in
      both Houses. She watched her moment for a dissolution, created twelve Tory
      peers, and succeeded. Thirty years later, the House of Commons drove
      Walpole from his seat. In 1784, George III. was able to keep Mr. Pitt in
      office in the face of a majority of the House of Commons. In 1804, the
      apprehension of a defeat in Parliament compelled the same King to part
      from his most favoured minister. But, in 1807, he was able to do <span
      class="pagenum">26</span><a name="link26" id="link26"></a>exactly what
      Anne had done nearly a hundred years before. Now, had the power of the
      King increased during the intervening century, or had it remained
      stationary? Is it possible that the one lot among the infinite number
      should have fallen to us? If not, Mr. Mill has proved that one of the two
      parties must have been constantly taking from the other. Many of the
      ablest men in England think that the influence of the Crown has, on the
      whole, increased since the reign of Anne. Others think that the Parliament
      has been growing in strength. But of this there is no doubt, that both
      sides possessed great power then, and possess great power now. Surely, if
      there were the least truth in the argument of Mr. Mill, it could not
      possibly be a matter of doubt, at the end of a hundred and twenty years,
      whether the one side or the other had been the gainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we ask pardon. We forgot that a fact, irreconcilable with Mr. Mill&rsquo;s
      theory, furnishes, in his opinion, the strongest reason for adhering to
      the theory. To take up the question in another manner, is it not plain
      that there may be two bodies, each possessing a perfect and entire power,
      which cannot be taken from it without its own concurrence? What is the
      meaning of the words stronger and weaker, when applied to such bodies as
      these? The one may, indeed, by physical force, altogether destroy the
      other. But this is not the question. A third party, a general of their
      own, for example, may, by physical force, subjugate them both. Nor is
      there any form of government, Mr. Mill&rsquo;s utopian democracy not
      excepted, secure from such an occurrence. We are speaking of the powers
      with which the constitution invests the two branches of the legislature:
      and we ask Mr. Mill how, on his own principles, he can <span
      class="pagenum">27</span><a name="link27" id="link27"></a>maintain that
      one of them will be able to encroach on the other, if the consent of the
      other be necessary to such encroachment?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mill tells us that, if a government be composed of the three simple
      forms, which he will not admit the British constitution to be, two of the
      component parts will inevitably join against the third. Now, if two of
      them combine and act as one, this case evidently resolves itself into the
      last; and all the observations which we have just made will fully apply to
      it. Mr. Mill says, that &ldquo;any two of the parties, by combining, may
      swallow up the third;&rdquo; and afterwards asks, &ldquo;How it is
      possible to prevent two of them from combining to swallow up the third?&rdquo;
      Surely Mr. Mill must be aware that in politics two is not always the
      double of one. If the concurrence of all the three branches of the
      legislature be necessary to every law, each branch will possess
      constitutional power sufficient to protect it against any thing but that
      physical force from which no form of government is secure. Mr. Mill
      reminds us of the Irishman, who could not be brought to understand how one
      juryman could possibly starve out eleven others.
    </p>
    <p>
      But is it certain that two of the branches of the legislature will combine
      against the third? &ldquo;It appears to be as certain,&rdquo; says Mr.
      Mill, &ldquo;as any thing which depends upon human will; because there are
      strong motives in favour of it, and none that can be conceived in
      opposition to it.&rdquo; He subsequently sets forth what these motives
      are. The interest of the democracy is that each individual should receive
      protection. The interest of the King and the aristocracy is to have all
      the power that they can obtain, and to use it for their own ends.
      Therefore the King and the <span class="pagenum">28</span><a name="link28"
      id="link28"></a>aristocracy have all possible motives for combining
      against the people. If our readers will look back to the passage quoted
      above, they will see that we represent Mr. Mill&rsquo;s argument quite
      fairly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we should have thought that, without the help of either history or
      experience, Mr. Mill would have discovered, by the light of his own logic,
      the fallacy which lurks, and indeed scarcely lurks, under this pretended
      demonstration. The interest of the King may be opposed to that of the
      people. But is it identical with that of the aristocracy? In the very page
      which contains this argument, intended to prove that the King and the
      aristocracy will coalesce against the people, Mr. Mill attempts to show
      that there is so strong an opposition of interest between the King and the
      aristocracy that if the powers of government are divided between them the
      one will inevitably usurp the power of the other. If so, he is not
      entitled to conclude that they will combine to destroy the power of the
      people merely because their interests may be at variance with those of the
      people. He is bound to show, not merely that in all communities the
      interest of a king must be opposed to that of the people, but also that,
      in all communities, it must be more directly opposed to the interest of
      the people than to the interest of the aristocracy. But he has not shown
      this. Therefore he has not proved his proposition on his own principles.
      To quote history would be a mere waste of time. Every schoolboy, whose
      studies have gone so far as the Abridgments of Goldsmith, can mention
      instances in which sovereigns have allied themselves with the people
      against the aristocracy, and in which the nobles have allied themselves
      with the people against the sovereign. In general, when there are three
      parties <span class="pagenum">29</span><a name="link29" id="link29"></a>every
      one of which has much to fear from the others, it is not found that two of
      them combine to plunder the third. If such a combination be formed it
      scarcely ever effects its purpose. It soon becomes evident which member of
      the coalition is likely to be the greater gainer by the transaction. He
      becomes an object of jealousy to his ally, who, in all probability,
      changes sides, and compels him to restore what he has taken. Everybody
      knows how Henry VIII. trimmed between Francis and the Emperor Charles. But
      it is idle to cite examples of the operation of a principle which is
      illustrated in almost every page of history, ancient or modern, and to
      which almost every state in Europe has, at one time or another, been
      indebted for its independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mill has now, as he conceives, demonstrated that the simple forms of
      government are bad, and that the mixed forms cannot possibly exist. There
      is still, however, it seems, a hope for mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>In the grand discovery of modern times, the system of
      representation, the solution of all the difficulties, both speculative and
      practical, will perhaps be found. If it cannot, we seem to be forced upon
      the extraordinary conclusion, that good government is impossible. For, as
      there is no individual or combination of individuals, except the community
      itself, who would not have an interest in bad government if intrusted with
      its powers, and as the community itself is incapable of exercising those
      powers, and must intrust them to certain individuals, the conclusion is
      obvious: the community itself must check those individuals; else they will
      follow their interest, and produce bad government. But how is it the
      community can cheek? The community can act only when assembled; and when
      assembled, it is incapable of acting. The community, however, can choose
      representatives</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next question is&mdash;How must the representative body be
      constituted? Mr. Mill lays down two principles, <span class="pagenum">30</span><a
      name="link30" id="link30"></a>about which, he says, &ldquo;it is unlikely
      that there will be any dispute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, The checking body must haye a degree of power sufficient for
      the business of checking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secondly, It must have an identity of interest with the community.
      Otherwise, it will make a mischievous use of its power.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of these propositions certainly admits of no dispute. As to the
      second, we shall hereafter take occasion to make some remarks on the sense
      in which Mr. Mill understands the words &ldquo;interest of the community.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not appear very easy, on Mr. Mill&rsquo;s principles, to find out
      any mode of making the interest of the representative body identical with
      that of the constituent body. The plan proposed by Mr. Mill is simply that
      of very frequent election. &ldquo;As it appears,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that
      limiting the duration of their power is a security against the sinister
      interest of the people&rsquo;s representatives, so it appears that it is
      the only security of which the nature of the case admits.&rdquo; But all
      the arguments by which Mr. Mill has proved monarchy and aristocracy to be
      pernicious will, as it appears to us, equally prove this security to be no
      security at all. Is it not clear that the representatives, as soon as they
      are elected, are an aristocracy, with an interest opposed to the interest
      of the community? Why should they not pass a law for extending the term of
      their power from one year to ten years, or declare themselves senators for
      life? If the whole legislative power is given to them, they will be
      constitutionally competent to do this. If part of the legislative power is
      withheld from them, to whom is that part given? Is the people to retain
      it, and to express its assent or dissent in primary <span class="pagenum">31</span><a
      name="link31" id="link31"></a>assemblies? Mr. Mill himself tells us that
      the community can only act when assembled, and that, when assembled, it is
      incapable of acting. Or is it to be provided, as in some of the American
      republics, that no change in the fundamental laws shall be made without
      the consent of a convention, specially elected for the purpose? Still the
      difficulty recurs: Why may not the members of the convention betray their
      trust, as well as the members of the ordinary legislature? When private
      men, they may have been zealous for the interests of the community. When
      candidates, they may have pledged themselves to the cause of the
      constitution. But, as soon as they are a convention, as soon as they are
      separated from the people, as soon as the supreme power is put into their
      hands, commences that interest opposite to the interest of the community
      which must, according to Mr. Mill, produce measures opposite to the
      interests of the community. We must find some other means, therefore, of
      checking this check upon a check; some other prop to carry the tortoise,
      that carries the elephant, that carries the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know well that there is no real danger in such a case. But there is no
      danger only because there is no truth in Mr. Mill&rsquo;s principles. If
      men were what he represents them to be, the letter of the very
      constitution which he recommends would afford no safeguard against bad
      government. The real security is this, that legislators will be deterred
      by the fear of resistance and of infamy from acting in the manner which we
      have described. But restraints, exactly the same in kind, and differing
      only in degree, exist in all forms of government. That broad line of
      distinction which Mr. Mill tries to point out between monarchies and
      aristocracies <span class="pagenum">32</span><a name="link32" id="link32"></a>on
      the one side, and democracies on the other, has in fact no existence. In
      no form of government is there an absolute identity of interest between
      the people and their rulers. In every form of government, the rulers stand
      in some awe of the people. The fear of resistance and the sense of shame
      operate, in a certain degree, on the most absolute kings and the most
      illiberal oligarchies. And nothing but the fear of resistance and the
      sense of shame preserves the freedom of the most democratic communities
      from the encroachments of their annual and biennial delegates.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen how Mr. Mill proposes to render the interest of the
      representative body identical with that of the constituent body. The next
      question is, in what manner the interest of the constituent body is to be
      rendered identical with that of the community. Mr. Mill shows that a
      minority of the community, consisting even of many thousands, would be a
      bad constituent body, and, indeed, merely a numerous aristocracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The benefits of the representative system,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;are
      lost, in all cases in which the interests of the choosing body are not the
      same with those of the community. It is very evident, that if the
      community itself were the choosing body, the interest of the community and
      that of the choosing body would be the same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On these grounds Mr. Mill recommends that all males of mature age, rich
      and poor, educated and ignorant, shall have votes. But why not the women
      too? This question has often been asked in parliamentary debate, and has
      never, to our knowledge, received a plausible answer. Mr. Mill escapes
      from it as fast as he can. But we shall take the liberty to dwell a little
      on the words of the oracle. &ldquo;One thing,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is
      <span class="pagenum">33</span><a name="link33" id="link33"></a>pretty
      clear, that all those individuals whose interests are involved in those of
      other individuals, may be struck off without inconvenience.... In this
      light women may be regarded, the interest of almost all of whom is
      involved either in that of their fathers, or in that of their husbands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If we were to content ourselves with saying, in answer to all the
      arguments in Mr. Mill&rsquo;s essay, that the interest of a king is
      involved in that of the community, we should be accused, and justly, of
      talking nonsense. Yet such an assertion would not, as far as we can
      perceive, be more unreasonable than that which Mr. Mill has here ventured
      to make. Without adducing one fact, without taking the trouble to perplex
      the question by one sophism, he placidly dogmatises away the interest of
      one half of the human race. If there be a word of truth in history, women
      have always been, and still are, over the greater part of the globe,
      humble companions, playthings, captives, menials, beasts of burden. Except
      in a few happy and highly civilised communities, they are strictly in a
      state of personal slavery. Even in those countries where they are best
      treated, the laws are generally unfavourable to them, with respect to
      almost all the points in which they are most deeply interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mill is not legislating for England or the United States; but for
      mankind. Is then the interest of a Turk the same with that of the girls
      who compose his harem? Is the interest of a Chinese the same with that of
      the woman whom he harnesses to his plough? Is the interest of an Italian
      the same with that of the daughter whom he devotes to God? The interest of
      a respectable Englishman may be said, without any impropriety, to be
      identical with that of his wife. But <span class="pagenum">34</span><a
      name="link34" id="link34"></a>why is it so? Because human nature is <i>not</i>
      what Mr. Mill conceives it to be; because civilised men, pursuing their
      own happiness in a social state, are not Yahoos fighting for carrion;
      because there is a pleasure in being loved and esteemed, as well as in
      being feared and servilely obeyed. Why does not a gentleman restrict his
      wife to the bare maintenance which the law would compel him to allow her,
      that he may have more to spend on his personal pleasures? Because, if he
      loves her, he has pleasure in seeing her pleased; and because, even if he
      dislikes her, he is unwilling that the whole neighbourhood should cry
      shame on his meanness and ill-nature. Why does not the legislature,
      altogether composed of males, pass a law to deprive women of all civil
      privileges whatever, and reduce them to the state of slaves? By passing
      such a law, they would gratify what Mr. Mill tells us is an inseparable
      part of human nature, the desire to possess unlimited power of inflicting
      pain upon others. That they do not pass such a law, though they have the
      power to pass it, and that no man in England wishes to see such a law
      passed, proves that the desire to possess unlimited power of inflicting
      pain is not inseparable from human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there be in this country an identity of interest between the two sexes,
      it cannot possibly arise from any thing but the pleasure of being loved,
      and of communicating happiness. For, that it does not spring from the mere
      instinct of sex, the treatment which women experience over the greater
      part of the world abundantly proves. And, if it be said that our laws of
      marriage have produced it, this only removes the argument a step further;
      for those laws have been made by males. Now, if the kind feelings of one
      half of the species be a sufficient security for the happiness of the
      other, <span class="pagenum">35</span><a name="link35" id="link35"></a>why
      may not the kind feelings of a monarch or an aristocracy he sufficient at
      least to prevent them from grinding the people to the very utmost of their
      power?
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Mill will examine why it is that women are better treated in
      England than in Persia, he may perhaps find out, in the course of his
      inquiries, why it is that the Danes are better governed than the subjects
      of Caligula.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now come to the most important practical question in the whole essay.
      Is it desirable that all males arrived at years of discretion should vote
      for representatives, or should a pecuniary qualification be required? Mr.
      Mill&rsquo;s opinion is, that the lower the qualification the better; and
      that the best system is that in which there is none at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The qualification,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;must either be such as
      to embrace the majority of the population, or something less than the
      majority. Suppose, in the first place, that it embraces the majority, the
      question is, whether the majority would have an interest in oppressing
      those who, upon this supposition, would be deprived of political power? If
      we reduce the calculation to its elements, we shall see that the interest
      which they would have of this deplorable kind, though it would be
      something, would not be very great. Each man of the majority, if the
      majority were constituted the governing body, would have something less
      than the benefit of oppressing a single man. If the majority were twice as
      great as the minority, each man of the majority would only have one half
      the benefit of oppressing a single man.... Suppose, in the second place,
      that the qualification did not admit a body of electors so large as the
      majority, in that case taking again the calculation in its elements, we
      shall see that each man would have a benefit equal to that derived from
      the oppression of more than one man; and that, in proportion as the
      elective body constituted a smaller and smaller minority, the benefit of
      misrule to the elective body would be increased, and bad government would
      be insured</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The first remark which we have to make on this argument <span
      class="pagenum">36</span><a name="link36" id="link36"></a>is, that, by Mr.
      Mill&rsquo;s own account, even a government in which every human being
      should vote would still be defective. For, under a system of universal
      suffrage, the majority of the electors return the representative, and the
      majority of the representatives make the law. The whole people may vote,
      therefore; but only the majority govern. So that, by Mr. Mill&rsquo;s own
      confession, the most perfect system of government conceivable is one in
      which the interest of the ruling body to oppress, though not great, is
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      But is Mr. Mill in the right when he says that such an interest could not
      be very great? We think not. If, indeed, every man in the community
      possessed an equal share of what Mr. Mill calls the objects of desire, the
      majority would probably abstain from plundering the minority. A large
      minority would offer a vigorous resistance; and the property of a small
      minority would not repay the other members of the community for the
      trouble of dividing it. But it happens that in all civilised communities
      there is a small minority of rich men, and a great majority of poor men.
      If there were a thousand men with ten pounds apiece, it would not be worth
      while for nine hundred and ninety of them to rob ten, and it would be a
      bold attempt for six hundred of them to rob four hundred. But, if ten of
      them had a hundred thousand pounds apiece, the case would be very
      different. There would then be much to be got, and nothing to be feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That one human being will desire to render the person and property
      of another subservient to his pleasures, notwithstanding the pain or loss
      of pleasure which it may occasion to that other individual, is,&rdquo;
      according to Mr. Mill, &ldquo;the foundation of government.&rdquo; That
      the property of the rich minority can be made subservient <span
      class="pagenum">37</span><a name="link37" id="link37"></a>to the pleasures
      of the poor majority will scarcely be denied. But Mr. Mill proposes to
      give the poor majority power over the rich minority. Is it possible to
      doubt to what, on his own principles such an arrangement must lead?
    </p>
    <p>
      It may perhaps be said that, in the long run, it is for the interest of
      the people that property should be secure, and that therefore they will
      respect it. We answer thus:&mdash;It cannot be pretended that it is not
      for the immediate interest of the people to plunder the rich. Therefore,
      even if it were quite certain that, in the long run, the people would, as
      a body, lose by doing so, it would not necessarily follow that the fear of
      remote ill consequences would overcome the desire of immediate
      acquisitions. Every individual might flatter himself that the punishment
      would not fall on him. Mr. Mill himself tells us, in his Essay on
      Jurisprudence, that no quantity of evil which is remote and uncertain will
      suffice to prevent crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we are rather inclined to think that it would, on the whole, be for
      the interest of the majority to plunder the rich. If so, the Utilitarians
      will say, that the rich <i>ought</i> to be plundered. We deny the
      inference.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, in the first place, if the object of government be the greatest
      happiness of the greatest number, the intensity of the suffering which a
      measure inflicts must be taken into consideration, as well as the number
      of the sufferers. In the next place, we have to notice one most important
      distinction which Mr. Mill has altogether overlooked. Throughout his
      essay, he confounds the community with the species. He talks of the
      greatest happiness of the greatest number: but, when we examine his
      reasonings, we find that he thinks only of the greatest number of a single
      generation. <span class="pagenum">38</span><a name="link38" id="link38"></a>Therefore,
      even if we were to concede that all those arguments of which we have
      exposed the fallacy are unanswerable, we might still deny the conclusion
      at which the essayist arrives. Even if we were to grant that he had found
      out the form of government which is best for the majority of the people
      now living on the face of the earth, we might still without inconsistency
      maintain that form of government to be pernicious to mankind. It would
      still be incumbent on Mr. Mill to prove that the interest of every
      generation is identical with the interest of all succeeding generations.
      And how on his own principles he could do this we are at a loss to
      conceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case, indeed, is strictly analogous to that of an aristocratic
      government. In an aristocracy, says Mr. Mill, the few, being invested with
      the powers of government, can take the objects of their desires from the
      people. In the same manner, every generation in turn can gratify itself at
      the expense of posterity,&mdash;priority of time, in the latter case,
      giving an advantage exactly corresponding to that which superiority of
      station gives in the former. That an aristocracy will abuse its advantage,
      is, according to Mr. Mill, matter of demonstration. Is it not equally
      certain that the whole people will do the same; that, if they have the
      power, they will commit waste of every sort on the estate of mankind, and
      transmit it to posterity impoverished and desolated?
    </p>
    <p>
      How is it possible for any person who holds the doctrines of Mr. Mill to
      doubt that the rich, in a democracy such as that which he recommends,
      would be pillaged as unmercifully as under a Turkish Pacha? It is no doubt
      for the interest of the next generation, and it may be for the remote
      interest of the present <span class="pagenum">39</span><a
      name="link39_rdquo_________id_" id="link39_rdquo_________id_"></a>generation,
      that property should be held sacred. And so no doubt it will be for the
      interest of the next Pacha, and even for that of the present Pacha, if he
      should hold office long, that the inhabitants of his Pachalik should be
      encouraged to accumulate wealth. Scarcely any despotic sovereign has
      plundered his subjects to a large extent without having reason before the
      end of his reign to regret it. Every body knows how bitterly Louis the
      Fourteenth, towards the close of his life, lamented his former
      extravagance. If that magnificent prince had not expended millions on
      Marli and Versailles, and tens of millions on the aggrandisement of his
      grandson, he would not have been compelled at last to pay servile court to
      low-born money-lenders, to humble himself before men on whom, in the days
      of his pride, he would not have vouchsafed to look, for the means of
      supporting even his own household. Examples to the same effect might
      easily be multiplied. But despots, we see, do plunder their subjects,
      though history and experience tell them that, by prematurely exacting the
      means of profusion, they are in fact devouring the seed-corn from which
      the future harvest of revenue is to spring. Why then should we suppose
      that the people will be deterred from procuring immediate relief and
      enjoyment by the fear of distant calamities, of calamities which perhaps
      may not be fully felt till the times of their grand-children?
    </p>
    <p>
      These conclusions are strictly drawn from Mr. Mill&rsquo;s own principles:
      and, unlike most of the conclusions which he has himself drawn from those
      principles, they are not, as far as we know, contradicted by facts. The
      case of the United States is not in point. In a country where the
      necessaries of life are cheap and the wages of labour high, where a man
      who has no capital <span class="pagenum">40</span><a
      name="link40_rdquo_________id_" id="link40_rdquo_________id_"></a>but his
      legs and arms may expect to become rich by industry and frugality, it is
      not very decidedly even for the immediate advantage of the poor to plunder
      the rich; and the punishment of doing so would very speedily follow the
      offence. But in countries in which the great majority live from hand to
      mouth, and in which vast masses of wealth have been accumulated by a
      comparatively small number, the case is widely different. The immediate
      want is, at particular seasons, craving, imperious, irresistible. In our
      own time it has steeled men to the fear of the gallows, and urged them on
      the point of the bayonet. And, if these men had at their command that
      gallows and those bayonets which now scarcely restrain them, what is to be
      expected? Nor is this state of things one which can exist only under a bad
      government. If there be the least truth in the doctrines of the school to
      which Mr. Mill belongs, the increase of population will necessarily
      produce it everywhere. The increase of population is accelerated by good
      and cheap government. Therefore, the better the government, the greater is
      the inequality of conditions: and the greater the inequality of
      conditions, the stronger are the motives which impel the populace to
      spoliation. As for America, we appeal to the twentieth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is scarcely necessary to discuss the effects which a general spoliation
      of the rich would produce. It may indeed happen that, where a legal and
      political system full of abuses is inseparably bound up with the
      institution of property, a nation may gain by a single convulsion, in
      which both perish together. The price is fearful. But, if, when the shock
      is over, a new order of things should arise under which property may enjoy
      security, the industry of individuals will soon <span class="pagenum">41</span><a
      name="link41" id="link41"></a>repair the devastation. Thus we entertain no
      doubt that the Revolution was, on the whole, a most salutary event for
      France. But would France have gained if, ever since the year 1793, she had
      been governed by a democratic convention? If Mr. Mill&rsquo;s principles
      be sound, we say that almost her whole capital would by this time have
      been annihilated. As soon as the first explosion was beginning to be
      forgotten, as soon as wealth again began to germinate, as soon as the poor
      again began to compare their cottages and salads with the hotels and
      banquets of the rich, there would have been another scramble for property,
      another maximum, another general confiscation, another reign of terror.
      Four or five such convulsions following each other, at intervals of ten or
      twelve years, would reduce the most flourishing countries of Europe to the
      state of Barbary or the Morea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The civilised part of the world has now nothing to fear from the hostility
      of savage nations. Once the deluge of barbarism has passed over it, to
      destroy and to fertilise; and in the present state of mankind we enjoy a
      full security against that calamity. That flood will no more return to
      cover the earth. But is it possible that in the bosom of civilisation
      itself may be engendered the malady which shall destroy it? Is it possible
      that institutions may be established which, without the help of
      earthquake, of famine, of pestilence, or of the foreign sword, may undo
      the work of so many ages of wisdom and glory, and gradually sweep away
      taste, literature, science, commerce, manufactures, everything but the
      rude arts necessary to the support of animal life? Is it possible that, in
      two or three hundred years, a few lean and half-naked fishermen may divide
      with owls and foxes the ruins of the <span class="pagenum">42</span><a
      name="link42" id="link42"></a>greatest European cities&mdash;may wash
      their nets amidst the relics of&rsquo; her gigantic docks, and build their
      huts out of the capitals of her stately cathedrals? If the principles of
      Mr. Mill he sound, we say, without hesitation, that the form of government
      which he recommends will assuredly produce all this. But, if these
      principles be unsound, if the reasonings by which we have opposed them be
      just, the higher and middling orders are the natural representatives of
      the human race. Their interest may be opposed in some things to that of
      their poorer contemporaries; but it is identical with that of the
      innumerable generations which are to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mill concludes his essay, by answering an objection often made to the
      project of universal suffrage&mdash;that the people do not understand
      their own interests. We shall not go through his arguments on this
      subject, because, till he has proved that it is for the interest of the
      people to respect property, he only makes matters worse by proving that
      they understand their interests. But we cannot refrain from treating our
      readers with a delicious <i>bonne bouche</i> of wisdom, which he has kept
      for the last moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The opinions of that class of the people who are below the
      middle rank are formed, and their minds are directed, by that intelligent,
      that virtuous rank, who come the most immediately in contact with them,
      who are in the constant habit of intimate communication with them, to whom
      they fly for advice and assistance in all their numerous difficulties,
      upon whom they feel an immediate and daily dependence in health and in
      sickness, in infancy and in old age, to whom their children look up as
      models for their imitation, whose opinions they hear daily repeated, and
      account it their honour to adopt. There can be no doubt that the middle
      rank, which gives to science, to art, and to legislation itself their most
      distinguished ornaments, and is the chief source of all that has exalted
      and refined human nature, is that portion of the community, of which, if
      the basis of representation were <span class="pagenum">43</span><a
      name="link43" id="link43"></a>ever so far extended, the opinion would
      ultimately decide. Of the people, beneath them, a vast majority would be
      sure to be guided by their advice and example</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This single paragraph is sufficient to upset Mr. Mill&rsquo;s theory. Will
      the people act against their own interest? Or will the middle rank act
      against its own interest? Or is the interest of the middle rank identical
      with the interest of the people? If the people act according to the
      directions of the middle rank, as Mr. Mill says that they assuredly will,
      one of these three questions must be answered in the affirmative. But, if
      any one of the three be answered in the affirmative, his whole system
      falls to the ground. If the interest of the middle rank be identical with
      that of the people, why should not the powers of government be intrusted
      to that rank? If the powers of government were intrusted to that rank,
      there would evidently be an aristocracy of wealth; and &ldquo;to
      constitute an aristocracy of wealth, though it were a very numerous one,
      would,&rdquo; according to Mr. Mill, &ldquo;leave the community without
      protection, and exposed to all the evils of unbridled power.&rdquo; Will
      not the same motives which induce, the middle classes to abuse one kind of
      power induce them to abuse another? If their interest be the same with
      that of the people they will govern the people well. If it be opposite to
      that of the people they will advise the people ill. The system of
      universal suffrage, therefore, according to Mr. Mill&rsquo;s own account,
      is only a device for doing circuitously what a representative system,
      with, a pretty high qualification, would do directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So ends this celebrated Essay. And such is this philosophy for which the
      experience of three thousand years is to be discarded; this philosophy,
      the professors <span class="pagenum">44</span><a name="link44" id="link44"></a>of
      which speak as if it had guided the world to the knowledge of navigation
      and alphabetical writing; as if, before its dawn, the inhabitants of
      Europe had lived in caverns and eaten each other! We are sick, it seems,
      like the children of Israel, of the objects of our old and legitimate
      worship. We pine for a new idolatry. All that is costly and all that is
      ornamental in our intellectual treasures must be delivered up, and cast
      into the furnace&mdash;and there comes out this Calf!
    </p>
    <p>
      Our readers can scarcely mistake our object in writing this article. They
      will not suspect us of any disposition to advocate the cause of absolute
      monarchy, or of any narrow form of oligarchy, or to exaggerate the evils
      of popular government. Our object at present is, not so much to attack or
      defend any particular system of polity, as to expose the vices of a kind
      of reasoning utterly unfit for moral and political discussions; of a kind
      of reasoning which may so readily be turned to purposes of falsehood that
      it ought to receive no quarter, even when by accident it may be employed
      on the side of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our objection to the essay of Mr. Mill is fundamental. We believe that it
      is utterly impossible to deduce the science of government from the
      principles of human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      What proposition is there respecting human nature which is absolutely and
      universally true? We know of only one: and that is not only true, but
      identical; that men always act from self-interest. This truism the
      Utilitarians proclaim with as much pride as if it were new, and as much
      zeal as if it were important. But in fact, when explained, it means only
      that men, if they can, will do as they choose. When we see the <span
      class="pagenum">45</span><a name="link45" id="link45"></a>actions of a man
      we know with certainty what he thinks his interest to be. But it is
      impossible to reason with certainty from what <i>we</i> take to be his
      interest to his actions. One man goes without a dinner that he may add a
      shilling to a hundred thousand pounds: another runs in debt to give balls
      and masquerades. One man cuts his father&rsquo;s throat to get possession
      of his old clothes: another hazards his own life to save that of an enemy.
      One man volunteers on a forlorn hope: another is drummed out of a regiment
      for cowardice. Each of these men has, no doubt, acted from self-interest.
      But we gain nothing by knowing this, except the pleasure, if it be one, of
      multiplying useless words. In fact, this principle is just as recondite
      and just as important as the great truth that whatever is, is. If a
      philosopher were always to state facts in the following form&mdash;&ldquo;There
      is a shower: but whatever is, is; therefore, there is a shower,&rdquo;&mdash;his
      reasoning would be perfectly sound; but we do not apprehend that it would
      materially enlarge the circle of human knowledge. And it is equally idle
      to attribute any importance to a proposition which, when interpreted,
      means only that a man had rather do what he had rather do.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the doctrine, that men always act from self-interest, be laid down in
      any other sense than this&mdash;if the meaning of the word self-interest
      be narrowed so as to exclude any one of the motives which may by
      possibility act on any human being,&mdash;the proposition ceases to be
      identical; but at the same time it Rases to be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      What we have said of the word &ldquo;self-interest&rdquo; applies to all
      the synonymes and circumlocutions which are employed to convey the same
      meaning; pain and pleasure, happiness and misery, objects of desire, and
      so forth. <span class="pagenum">46</span><a name="link46" id="link46"></a>The
      whole art of Mr. Mill&rsquo;s essay consists in one simple trick of
      legerdemain. It consists in using words of the sort which we have been
      describing first in one sense and then in another. Men will take the
      objects of their desire if they can. Unquestionably:&mdash;but this is an
      identical proposition: for an object of desire means merely a thing which
      a man will procure if he can. Nothing can possibly be inferred from a
      maxim of this kind. When we see a man take something we shall know that it
      was an object of his desire. But till then we have no means of judging
      with certainty what he desires or what he will take. The general
      proposition, however, having been admitted, Mr. Mill proceeds to reason as
      if men had no desires but those which can be gratified only by spoliation
      and oppression. It then becomes easy to deduce doctrines of vast
      importance from the original axiom. The only misfortune is, that by thus
      narrowing the meaning of the word desire the axiom becomes false, and all
      the doctrines consequent upon it are false likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we pass beyond those maxims which it is impossible to deny without a
      contradiction in terms, and which, therefore, do not enable us to advance
      a single step in practical knowledge, we do not believe that it is
      possible to lay down a single general rule respecting the motives which
      influence human actions. There is nothing which may not, by association or
      by comparison, become an object either of desire or of aversion. The fear
      of death is generally considered as one of the strongest of our feelings.
      It is the most formidable sanction which legislators have been able to
      devise. Yet it is notorious that, as Lord Bacon has observed, there is no
      passion by which that fear has not been often overcome. Physical pain is
      indisputably an evil; <span class="pagenum">47</span><a
      name="link47_rdquo_________id_" id="link47_rdquo_________id_"></a>yet it
      has been often endured, and even welcomed. Innumerable martyrs have
      exulted in torments which made the spectators shudder; and, to use a more
      homely illustration, there are few wives who do not long to be mothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is the love of approbation a stronger motive than the love of wealth? It
      is impossible to answer this question generally even in the case of an
      individual with whom we are very intimate. We often say, indeed, that a
      man loves fame more than money or money more than fame. But this is said
      in a loose and popular sense; for there is scarcely a man who would not
      endure a few sneers for a great sum of money, if he were in pecuniary
      distress; and scarcely a man, on the other hand, who, if he were in
      flourishing circumstances, would expose himself to the hatred and contempt
      of the public for a trifle. In order, therefore, to return a precise
      answer even about a single human being, we must know what is the amount of
      the sacrifice of reputation demanded and of the pecuniary advantage
      offered, and in what situation the person to whom the temptation is
      proposed stands at the time. But, when the question is propounded
      generally about the whole species, the impossibility of answering is still
      more evident. Man differs from man; generation from generation; nation
      from nation. Education, station, sex, age, accidental associations,
      produce infinite shades of variety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the only mode in which we can conceive it possible to deduce a theory
      of government from the principles of human nature is this. We must find
      out what are the motives which, in a particular form of government, impel
      rulers to bad measures, and what are those which impel them to good
      measures. We <span class="pagenum">48</span><a name="link48" id="link48"></a>must
      then compare the effect of the two classes of motives; and, according as
      we find the one or the other to prevail, we must pronounce the form of
      government in question good or bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let it be supposed that, in aristocratical and monarchical states, the
      desire of wealth and other desires of the same class always tend to
      produce mis-government, and that the love of approbation and other kindred
      feelings always tend to produce good government. Then, if it be
      impossible, as we have shown that it is, to pronounce generally which of
      the two classes of motives is the more influential, it is impossible to
      find out, <i>a priori</i>, whether a monarchical or aristocratical form of
      government be good or bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mill has avoided the difficulty of making the comparison, by very
      coolly putting all the weights into one of the scales,&mdash;by reasoning
      as if no human being had ever sympathised with the feelings, been
      gratified by the thanks, or been galled by the execrations, of another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case, as we have put it, is decisive against Mr. Mill; and yet we have
      put it in a manner far too favourable to him. For, in fact, it is
      impossible to lay it down as a general rule that the love of wealth in a
      sovereign always produces misgovernment, or the love of approbation good
      government. A patient and farsighted ruler, for example, who is less
      desirous of raising a great sum immediately than of securing an
      unencumbered and progressive revenue, will, by taking off restraints from
      trade and giving perfect security to property, encourage accumulation and
      entice capital from foreign countries. The commercial policy of Prussia,
      which is perhaps superior to that of any country in the world, and which
      puts to shame the <span class="pagenum">49</span><a
      name="link49_rdquo_________id_" id="link49_rdquo_________id_"></a>absurdities
      of our republican brethren on the other side of the Atlantic, has probably
      sprung from the desire of an absolute ruler to enrich himself. On the
      other hand, when the popular estimate of virtues and vices is erroneous,
      which is too often the case, the love of approbation leads sovereigns to
      spend the wealth of the nation on useless shows, or to engage in wanton
      and destructive wars. If then we can neither compare the strength of two
      motives, nor determine with certainty to what description of actions
      either motive will lead, how can we possibly deduce a theory of government
      from the nature of man?
    </p>
    <p>
      How, then, are we to arrive at just conclusions on a subject so important
      to the happiness of mankind? Surely by that method which, in every
      experimental science to which it has been applied, has signally increased
      the power and knowledge of our species,&mdash;by that method for which our
      new philosophers would substitute quibbles scarcely worthy of the
      barbarous respondents and opponents of the middle ages,&mdash;by the
      method of Induction;&mdash;by observing the present state of the world,&mdash;by
      assiduously studying the history of past ages,&mdash;by sifting the
      evidence of facts,&mdash;by carefully combining and contrasting those
      which are authentic,&mdash;by generalising with judgment and diffidence,&mdash;by
      perpetually bringing the theory which we have constructed to the test of
      new facts,&mdash;by correcting, or altogether abandoning it, according as
      those new facts prove it to be partially or fundamentally unsound.
      Proceeding thus,&mdash;patiently,&mdash;diligently,&mdash;candidly,&mdash;we
      may hope to form a system as far inferior in pretension to that which we
      have been examining and as far superior to it in real utility as the
      prescriptions of a great physician, varying with every <span
      class="pagenum">50</span><a name="link50" id="link50"></a>stage of every
      malady and with the constitution of every patient, to the pill of the
      advertising quack which is to cure all human beings, in all climates, of
      all diseases.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is that noble Science of Politics, which is equally removed from the
      barren theories of the Utilitarian sophists, and from the petty craft, so
      often mistaken for statesmanship by minds grown narrow in habits of
      intrigue, jobbing, and official etiquette;&mdash;which of all sciences is
      the most important to the welfare of nations,&mdash;which of all sciences
      most tends to expand and invigorate the mind,&mdash;which draws nutriment
      and ornament from every part of philosophy and literature, and dispenses
      in return nutriment and ornament to all. We are sorry and surprised when
      we see men of good intentions and good natural abilities abandon this
      healthful and generous study to pore over speculations like those which we
      have been examining. And we should heartily rejoice to find that our
      remarks had induced any person of this description to employ, In
      researches of real utility, the talents and industry which are now wasted
      on verbal sophisms, wretched of their wretched kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the greater part of the sect, it is, we apprehend, of little
      consequence what they study or under whom. It would be more amusing, to be
      sure, and more reputable, if they would take up the old republican cant
      and declaim about Brutus and Timoleon, the duty of killing tyrants and the
      blessedness of dying for liberty. But, on the whole, they might have
      chosen worse. They may as well be Utilitarians as jockeys or dandies. And,
      though quibbling about self-interest and motives, and objects of desire,
      and the greatest happiness of the greatest number, is but a poor
      employment <span class="pagenum">51</span><a name="link51" id="link51"></a>for
      a grown man, it certainly hurts the health less than hard drinking and the
      fortune less than high play; it is not much more laughable than
      phrenology, and is immeasurably more humane than cock-fighting.

      WESTMINSTER REVIEWER&rsquo;S DEFENCE OF MILL.(1)
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (Edinburgh Review, June 1829.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e <span
      class="pagenum">52</span><a name="link52" id="link52"></a>have had great
      reason, we think, to be gratified by the success of our late attack on the
      Utilitarians. We could publish a long list of the cures which it has
      wrought in cases previously considered as hopeless. Delicacy forbids us to
      divulge names; but we cannot refrain from alluding to two remarkable
      instances. A respectable lady writes to inform us that her son, who was
      plucked at Cambridge last January, has not been heard to call Sir James
      Mackintosh a poor ignorant fool more than twice since the appearance of
      our article. A distinguished political writer in the Westminster and
      Parliamentary Reviews has borrowed Hume&rsquo;s History, and has actually
      got as far as the battle of Agincourt. He assures us that he takes great
      pleasure in his new study, and that he is very impatient to learn how
      Scotland and England became one kingdom. But the greatest compliment that
      we have received is that Mr. Bentham himself should have condescended to
      take the field in defence of Mr. Mill. We have not been in the habit of
      reviewing reviews; but, as Mr. Bentham is a truly great man, and as his
      party have thought fit to announce in puffs and placards that this
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) The Westminster Review. No. XXI. Article XVI. Edinburgh
     Review. No. XCVII. Article on Mill&rsquo;s Essays on Government,
     &amp;c. <span class="pagenum">53</span><a name="link53" id="link53"></a>
</pre>
    <p>
      article is written by him, and contains not only an answer to our attacks,
      but a development of the &ldquo;greatest happiness principle,&rdquo; with
      the latest improvements of the author, we shall for once depart from our
      general rule. However the conflict may terminate, we shall at least not
      have been vanquished by an ignoble hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Mr. Bentham himself we shall endeavour, even while defending ourselves
      against his reproaches, to speak with the respect to which his venerable
      age, his genius, and his public services entitle him. If any harsh
      expression should escape us, we trust that he will attribute it to
      inadvertence, to the momentary warmth of controversy,&mdash;to anything,
      in short, rather than to a design of affronting him. Though we have
      nothing in common with the crew of Hurds and Boswells, who, either from
      interested motives, or from the habit of intellectual servility and
      dependence, pamper and vitiate his appetite with the noxious sweetness of
      their undiscerning praise, we are not perhaps less competent than they to
      appreciate his merit, or less sincerely disposed to acknowledge it. Though
      we may sometimes think his reasonings on moral and political questions
      feeble and sophistical&mdash;though we may sometimes smile at his
      extraordinary language&mdash;we can never be weary of admiring the
      amplitude of his comprehension, the keenness of his penetration, the
      exuberant fertility with which his mind pours forth arguments and
      illustrations. However sharply he may speak of us, we can never cease to
      revere in him the father of the philosophy of Jurisprudence. He has a full
      right to all the privileges of a great inventor; and, in our court of
      criticism, those privileges will never be pleaded in vain. But they are
      limited in the same manner in which, fortunately for the ends of justice,
      the privileges of the peerage <span class="pagenum">54</span><a
      name="link54" id="link54"></a>are now limited. The advantage is personal
      and incommunicable. A nobleman can now no longer cover with his protection
      every lackey who follows his heels, or every bully who draws in his
      quarrel: and, highly as we respect the exalted rank which Mr. Bentham
      holds among the writers of our time, yet when, for the due maintenance of
      literary police, we shall think it necessary to confute sophists, or to
      bring pretenders to shame, we shall not depart from the ordinary course of
      our proceedings because the offenders call themselves Benthamites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Mr. Mill has much reason to thank Mr. Bentham for undertaking his
      defence, our readers, when they have finished this article, will perhaps
      be inclined to doubt. Great as Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s talents are, he has, we
      think, shown an undue confidence in them. He should have considered how
      dangerous it is for any man, however eloquent and ingenious he may be, to
      attack or defend a book without reading it: and we feel quite convinced
      that Mr. Bentham would never have written the article before us if he had,
      before he began, perused our review with attention, and compared it with
      Mr. Mill&rsquo;s Essay.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has utterly mistaken our object and meaning. He seems to think that we
      have undertaken to set up some theory of government in opposition to that
      of Mr. Mill. But we distinctly disclaimed any such design. From the
      beginning to the end of our article, there is not, as far as we remember,
      a single sentence which, when fairly construed, can be considered as
      indicating any such design. If such an expression can be found, it has
      been dropped by inadvertence. Our object was to prove, not that monarchy
      and aristocracy, are good, but that Mr. Mill had not proved them to be
      bad; not <span class="pagenum">55</span><a name="link55" id="link55"></a>that
      democracy is bad, but that Mr. Mill had not proved it to be good. The
      points in issue are these: whether the famous Essay on Government be, as
      it has been called, a perfect solution of the great political problem, or
      a series of sophisms and blunders; and whether the sect which, while it
      glories in the precision of its logic, extols this Essay as a masterpiece
      of demonstration, be a sect deserving of the respect or of the derision of
      mankind. These, we say, are the issues; and on these we with full
      confidence put ourselves on the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not necessary, for the purposes of this investigation, that we
      should state what our political creed is, or whether we have any political
      creed at all. A man who cannot act the most trivial part in a farce has a
      right to hiss Romeo Coates: a man who does not know a vein from an artery
      may caution a simple neighbour against the advertisements of Dr. Eady. A
      complete theory of government would indeed be a noble present to mankind;
      but it is a present which we do not hope and do not pretend that we can
      offer. If, however, we cannot lav the foundation, it is something to clear
      away the rubbish; if we cannot set up truth, it is something to pull down
      error. Even if the subjects of which the Utilitarians treat were subjects
      of less fearful importance, we should think it no small service to the
      cause of good sense and good taste to point out the contrast between their
      magnificent pretensions and their miserable performances. Some of them
      have, however, thought fit to display their ingenuity on questions of the
      most momentous kind, and on questions concerning which men cannot reason
      ill with impunity. We think it, under these circumstances, an absolute
      duty to expose the fallacy of their arguments. It is no matter <span
      class="pagenum">56</span><a name="link56" id="link56"></a>of pride or of
      pleasure. To read their works is the most soporific employment that we
      know; and a man ought no more to be proud of refuting them than of having
      two legs. We must now come to close quarters with Mr. Bentham, whom, we
      need not say, we do not mean to include in this observation. He charges us
      with maintaining,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>First, &lsquo;That it is not true that all despots govern ill;&rsquo;&mdash;whereon
      the world is in a mistake, and the Whigs have the true light. And for
      proof, principally,&mdash;that the King of Denmark is not Caligula. To
      which the answer is, that the King of Denmark is not a despot. He was put
      in his present situation by the people turning the scale in his favour in
      a balanced contest between himself and the nobility. And it is quite clear
      that the same power would turn the scale the other way the moment a King
      of Denmark should take into his head to be Caligula. It is of little
      consequence by what congeries of letters the Majesty of Denmark is
      typified in the royal press of Copenhagen, while the real fact is that the
      sword of the people is suspended over his head, in ease of ill-behaviour,
      as effectually as in other countries where more noise is made upon the
      subject. Every body believes the sovereign of Denmark to be a good and
      virtuous gentleman; but there is no more superhuman merit in his being so
      than in the ease of a rural squire who does not shoot his land-steward or
      quarter his wife with his yeomanry sabre. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true that there are partial exceptions to the rule, that all
      men use power as badly as they dare. There may have been such things as
      amiable negro-drivers and sentimental masters of press-gangs; and here and
      there, among the odd freaks of human nature, there may have been specimens
      of men who were not tyrants, though bred up to tyranny.&rsquo; But it
      would be as wise to recommend wolves for nurses at the Foundling on the
      credit of Romulus and Remus as to substitute the exception for the general
      fact, and advise mankind to take to trusting to arbitrary power on the
      credit of these specimens.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in the first place, we never cited the case of Denmark to prove that
      all despots do not govern ill. We cited it to prove that Mr. Mill did not
      know how <span class="pagenum">57</span><a name="link57" id="link57"></a>to
      reason. Mr. Mill gave it as a reason for deducing the theory of government
      from the general laws of human nature that the King of Denmark was not
      Caligula. This we said, and we still say, was absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second place, it was not we, but Mr. Mill, who said that the King
      of Denmark was a despot. His words are these:&mdash;&ldquo;The people of
      Denmark, tired out with the oppression of an aristocracy, resolved that
      their king should be absolute; and under their absolute monarch are as
      well governed as any people in Europe.&rdquo; We leave Mr. Bentham to
      settle with Mr. Mill the distinction between a despot and an absolute
      king.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the third place, Mr. Bentham says that there was in Denmark a balanced
      contest between the king and the nobility. We find some difficulty in
      believing that Mr. Bentham seriously means to say this, when we consider
      that Mr. Mill has demonstrated the chance to be as infinity to one against
      the existence of such a balanced contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourthly, Mr. Bentham says that in this balanced contest the people turned
      the scale in favour of the king against the aristocracy. But Mr. Mill has
      demonstrated that it cannot possibly be for the interest of the monarchy
      and democracy to join against the aristocracy; and that, wherever the
      three parties exist, the king and the aristocracy will combine against the
      people. This, Mr. Mill assures us, is as certain as anything which depends
      upon human will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifthly, Mr. Bentham says that, if the King of Denmark were to oppress his
      people, the people and nobles would combine against the king. But Mr. Mill
      has proved that it can never be for the interest of the aristocracy to
      combine with the democracy against the <span class="pagenum">58</span><a
      name="link58" id="link58"></a>king. It is evidently Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s
      opinion, that &ldquo;monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy may balance each
      other, and by mutual checks produce good government.&rdquo; But this is
      the very theory which Mr. Mill pronounces to be the wildest, the most
      visionary, the most chimerical ever broached on the subject of government.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no dispute on these heads with Mr. Bentham. On the contrary, we
      think his explanation true&mdash;-or, at least, true in part; and we
      heartily thank him for lending us his assistance to demolish the essay of
      his follower. His wit and his sarcasm are sport to us; but they are death
      to his unhappy disciple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bentham seems to imagine that we have said something implying an
      opinion favourable to despotism. We can scarcely suppose that, as he has
      not condescended to read that portion of our work which he undertook to
      answer, he can have bestowed much attention on its general character. Had
      he done so he would, we think, scarcely have entertained such a suspicion.
      Mr. Mill asserts, and pretends to prove, that under no despotic government
      does any human being, except the tools of the sovereign, possess more than
      the necessaries of life, and that the most intense degree of terror is
      kept up by constant cruelty. This, we say, is untrue. It is not merely a
      rule to which there are exceptions: but it is not the rule. Despotism is
      bad; but it is scarcely anywhere so bad as Mr. Mill says that it is
      everywhere. This we are sure Mr. Bentham will allow. If a man were to say
      that five hundred thousand people die every year in London of
      dram-drinking, he would not assert a proposition more monstrously false
      than Mr. Mill&rsquo;s. Would it be just to charge us with defending
      intoxication because we might say that such a man was grossly in the
      wrong? <span class="pagenum">59</span><a name="link59" id="link59"></a>We
      say with Mr. Bentham that despotism is a bad thing. We say with Mr.
      Bentham that the exceptions do not destroy the authority of the rule. But
      this we say&mdash;that a single exception overthrows an argument which
      either does not prove the rule at all, or else proves the rule to be <i>true
      without exceptions</i>; and such an argument is Mr. Mill&rsquo;s argument
      against despotism. In this respect there is a great difference between
      rules drawl from experience and rules deduced <i>a priori</i>. We might
      believe that there had been a fall of snow last August, and yet not think
      it likely that there would be snow next August. A single occurrence
      opposed to our general experience would tell for very little in our
      calculation of the chances. But if we could once satisfy ourselves that in
      any single right-angled triangle the square of the hypothenuse might be
      less than the squares of the sides, we must reject the forty-seventh
      proposition of Euclid altogether. We willingly, adopt Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s
      lively illustration about the wolf; and we will say in passing that it
      gives us real pleasure to see how little old age has diminished the gaiety
      of this eminent man. We can assure him that his merriment gives us far
      more pleasure on his account than pain on our own. We say with him, Keep
      the wolf out of the nursery, in spite of the story of Romulus and Remus.
      But, if the shepherd who saw the wolf licking and suckling those famous
      twins were, after telling this story to his companions, to assert that it
      was an infallible rule that no wolf ever had spared, or ever would spare,
      any, living thing which might fall in its way&mdash;that its nature was
      carnivorous&mdash;and that it conld not possibly disobey its nature, we
      think that the hearers might have been excused for staring. It may be
      strange, but is not inconsistent, that a wolf which has eaten <span
      class="pagenum">60</span><a name="link60" id="link60"></a>ninety-nine
      children should spare the hundredth. But the fact that a wolf has once
      spared a child is sufficient to show that there must be some flaw in the
      chain of reasoning purporting to prove that wolves cannot possibly spare
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bentham proceeds to attack another position which he conceives us to
      maintain:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Secondly, That a government not under the control of the
      community (for there is no question upon any other) &lsquo;may soon be
      saturated.&rsquo; Tell it not in Bow-street, whisper it not in
      Hatton-garden&mdash;that there is a plan for preventing injustice by
      &lsquo;saturation.&rsquo; With what peals of unearthly merriment would
      Minos, √Üacus, and Rhadamanthus be aroused upon their benches, if the
      &lsquo;light wings of saffron and of blue&rsquo; should bear this theory
      into their grim domains! Why do not the owners of pocket-handkerchiefs try
      to &lsquo;saturate?&rsquo; Why does not the cheated publican beg leave to
      check the gulosity of his defrauder with a repetatur haustus, and the
      pummelled plaintiff neutralise the malice of his adversary, by requesting
      to have the rest of the beating In presence of the court,&mdash;if it is
      not that such conduct would run counter to all the conclusions of
      experience, and be the procreation of the mischief it affected to destroy?
      Woful is the man whose wealth depends on his having more than somebody
      else can be persuaded to take from him; and woful also is the people that
      is in such a case!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this is certainly very pleasant writing: but there is no great
      difficulty in answering the argument. The real reason which makes it
      absurd to think of preventing theft by pensioning off thieves is this,
      that there is no limit to the number of thieves. If there were only a
      hundred thieves in a place, and we were quite sure that no person not
      already addicted to theft would take to it, it might become a question
      whether to keep the thieves from dishonesty by raising them above distress
      would not be a better course than to employ officers against them. But the
      actual cases are <span class="pagenum">61</span><a
      name="link61_rdquo_________id_" id="link61_rdquo_________id_"></a>not
      parallel. Every man who chooses can become a thief; but a man cannot
      become a king or a member of the aristocracy whenever he chooses. The
      number of the depredators is limited; and therefore the amount of
      depredation, so far as physical pleasures are concerned, must be limited
      also. Now, we made the remark which Mr. Bentham censures with reference to
      physical pleasures only. The pleasures of ostentation, of taste, of
      revenge, and other pleasures of the same description, have, we distinctly
      allowed, no limit. Our words are these:&mdash;&ldquo;A king or an
      aristocracy may be supplied to satiety with <i>corporal pleasures</i>, at
      an expense which the rudest and poorest community would scarcely feel.&rdquo;
      Does Mr. Bentham deny this? If he does, we leave him to Mr. Mill. &ldquo;What,&rdquo;
      says that philosopher, in his Essay on Education, &ldquo;What are the
      ordinary pursuits of Wealth and power, Which kindle to such a height the
      ardour of mankind? Not the mere love of eating and of drinking, or all the
      physical objects together which wealth can purchase or power command. With
      these every man is in the long run speedily satisfied.&rdquo; What the
      difference is between being speedily satisfied and being soon saturated,
      we leave Mr. Bentham and Mr. Mill to settle together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word &lsquo;saturation,&rsquo; however, seems to provoke Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s
      mirth. It certainly did not strike us as very pure English; but, as Mr.
      Mill used it, we supposed it to be good Benthamese. With the latter
      language we are not critically acquainted, though, as it has many roots in
      common with our mother tongue, we can contrive, by the help of a converted
      Utilitarian, who attends us in the capacity of Moonshee, to make out a
      little. But Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s authority is of course decisive; and we
      bow to it. <span class="pagenum">62</span><a name="link62" id="link62"></a>Mr.
      Bentham next represents us as maintaining:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Thirdly, That &lsquo;though there may be some tastes and
      propensities that have no point of saturation, there exists a sufficient
      cheek in the desire of the good opinion of others.&rsquo; The misfortune
      of this argument is, that no man cares for the good opinion of those he
      has been accustomed to wrong. If oysters have opinions, it is probable
      they think very ill of those who eat them in August; but small is the
      effect upon the autumnal glutton that engulfs their gentle substances
      within his own. The planter and the slave-driver care just as much about
      negro opinion, as the epicure about the sentiments of oysters. M. Ude
      throwing live eels into the fire as a kindly method of divesting them of
      the unsavoury oil that lodges beneath their skins, is not more convinced
      of the immense aggregate of good which arises to the lordlier parts of the
      creation, than is the gentle peer who strips his fellow man of country and
      of family for a wild-fowl slain. The goodly land-owner, who lives by
      morsels squeezed indiscriminately from the waxy hands of the cobbler and
      the polluted ones of the nightman, is in no small degree the object of
      both hatred and contempt; but it is to be feared that he is a long way
      from feeling them to be intolerable. The principle of &lsquo;At mihi
      plaudo ipse domi, simul ac nununos contemplai&rsquo; in area&rsquo; is
      sufficient to make a wide interval between the opinions of the plaintiff
      and defendant in such eases. In short, to banish law and leave all
      plaintiffs to trust to the desire of reputation on the opposite side,
      would only be transporting the theory of the Whigs from the House of
      Commons to Westminster Hall</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in the first place, we never maintained the proposition which Mr.
      Bentham puts into our mouths. We said, and say, that there is a <i>certain</i>
      check to the rapacity and cruelty of men, in their desire of the good
      opinion of others. We never said that it was sufficient. Let Mr. Mill show
      it to be insufficient. It is enough for us to prove that there is a
      set-off against the principle from which Mr. Mill deduces the whole theory
      of government. The balance may be, and, we believe, will be, against
      despotism and the narrower forms of <span class="pagenum">63</span><a
      name="link63" id="link63"></a>aristocracy. But what is this to the
      correctness or incorrectness of Mr. Mill&rsquo;s accounts? The question is
      not, whether the motives which lead rulers to behave ill are stronger than
      those which lead them to behave well;&mdash;but, whether we ought to form
      a theory of government by looking <i>only</i> at the motives which lead
      rulers to behave ill and never noticing those which lead them to behave
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolute rulers, says Mr. Bentham, do not care for the good opinion of
      their subjects; for no man cares for the good opinion of those whom he has
      been accustomed to wrong. By Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s leave, this is a plain
      begging of the question. The point at issue is this:&mdash;Will kings and
      nobles wrong the people? The argument in favour of kings and nobles is
      this:&mdash;they will not wrong the people, because they care for the good
      opinion of the people. But this argument Mr. Bentham meets thus:&mdash;they
      will not care for the good opinion of the people, because they are
      accustomed to wrong the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Mill differs, as usual, from Mr. Bentham. &ldquo;The greatest
      princes,&rdquo; says he, in his Essay on Education, &ldquo;the most
      despotical masters of human destiny, when asked what they aim at by their
      wars and conquests, would answer, if sincere, as Frederick of Prussia
      answered, <i>pour faire parler de soi</i>;&mdash;to occupy a large space
      in the admiration of mankind.&rdquo; Putting Mr. Mill&rsquo;s and Mr.
      Bentham&rsquo;s principles together, we might make out very easily that
      &ldquo;the greatest princes, the most despotical masters of human destiny,&rdquo;
      would never abuse their power.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man who has been long accustomed to injure people must also have been
      long accustomed to do without their love, and to endure their aversion.
      Such a man <span class="pagenum">64</span><a name="link64" id="link64"></a>may
      not miss the pleasure of popularity; for men seldom miss a pleasure which
      they have long denied themselves. An old tyrant does without popularity
      just as an old water-drinker does without wine. But, though it is
      perfectly true that men who for the good of their health have long
      abstained from wine feel the want of it very little, it would be absurd to
      infer that men will always abstain from wine when their health requires
      that they should do so. And it would be equally absurd to say, because men
      who have been accustomed to oppress care little for popularity, that men
      will therefore necessarily prefer the pleasures of oppression to those of
      popularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, again, a man may be accustomed to wrong people in one point and not
      in another. He may care for their good opinion with regard to one point
      and not with regard to another. The Regent Orleans laughed at charges of
      impiety, libertinism, extravagance, idleness, disgraceful promotions. But
      the slightest allusion to the charge of poisoning threw him into
      convulsions. Louis the Fifteenth braved the hatred and contempt of his
      subjects during many years of the most odious and imbecile misgovernment.
      But, when a report was spread that he used human blood for his baths, he
      was almost driven mad by it. Surely Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s position &ldquo;that
      no man cares for the good opinion of those whom he has been accustomed to
      wrong&rdquo; would be objectionable, as far too sweeping and
      indiscriminate, even if it did not involve, as in the present case we have
      shown that it does, a direct begging of the question at issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bentham proceeds:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Fourthly, The Edinburgh Reviewers are of opinion, that &lsquo;it
      might, with no small plausibility, be maintained, that in many <span
      class="pagenum">65</span><a name="link65" id="link65"></a>countries, there
      are two classes which, in some decree, answer to this description;&rsquo;
      [viz.] &lsquo;that the poor compose the class which government is
      established to restrain; and the people of some property the class to
      which the powers of government may without danger be confided.&rsquo; </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They take great pains, it is true, to say this and not to say it.
      They shuffle and creep about, to secure a hole to escape at, if &lsquo;what
      they do not assert&rsquo; should be found in any degree inconvenient. A
      man might waste his life in trying to find out whether the Misses of the
      Edinburgh mean to say Yes or No in their political coquetry. But whichever
      way the lovely spinsters may decide, it is diametrically opposed to
      history and the evidence of facts, that the poor are<i> the class whom
      there is any difficulty in restraining. It is not the poor but the rich
      that have a propensity to take the property of other people. There is no
      instance upon earth of the poor having combined to take away the property
      of the rich; and all the instances habitually brought forward in support
      of it are gross misrepresentations, founded upon the most necessary acts
      of self-defence on the part of the most numerous classes. Such a
      misrepresentation is the common one of the Agrarian law; which was nothing
      but an attempt on the part of the Roman people to get back some part of
      what had been taken from them by undisguised robbery. Such another is the
      stock example of the French Revolution, appealed to by the Edinburgh
      Review in the actual case. It is utterly untrue that the French Revolution
      took place because &lsquo;the poor began to compare their cottages and
      salads with the hotels and banquets of the rich;&rsquo; it took place
      because they were robbed of their cottages and salads to support the
      hotels and banquets of their oppressors. It is utterly untrue that there
      was either a scramble for property or a general confiscation; the classes
      who took part with the foreign invaders lost their property, as they would
      have done here, and ought to do everywhere. All these are the vulgar
      errors of the man on the lion&rsquo;s back,&mdash;which the lion will set
      to rights when he can tell his own story. History is nothing but the
      relation of the sufferings of the poor from the rich; except precisely so
      far as the numerous classes of the community have contrived to keep the
      virtual power in their hands, or in other words, to establish free
      governments. If a poor man injures the rich, the law is instantly at his
      heels; the injuries of the rich towards the poor are always inflicted by
      the law. And to enable the rich <span class="pagenum">66</span><a
      name="link66" id="link66"></a>to do this to any extent that may be
      practicable or prudent, there is clearly one postulate required, which is,
      that the rich shall make the law</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This passage is alone sufficient to prove that Mr. Bentham has not taken
      the trouble to read our article from beginning to end. We are quite sure
      that he would not stoop to misrepresent it. And, if he had read it with
      any attention, he would have perceived that all this coquetry, this
      hesitation, this Yes and No, this saying and not saying, is simply an
      exercise of the undeniable right which in controversy belongs to the
      defensive side&mdash;to the side which proposes to establish nothing. The
      affirmative of the issue and the burden of the proof are with Mr. Mill,
      not with us. We are not bound, perhaps we are not able, to show that the
      form of government which he recommends is bad. It is quite enough if we
      can show that he does not prove it to be good. In his proof, among many
      other flaws, is this&mdash;He says, that if men are not inclined to
      plunder each other, government is unnecessary, and that, if men are so
      inclined, kings and aristocracies will plunder the people. Now this, we
      say, is a fallacy. That some men will plunder their neighbours if they
      can, is a sufficient reason for the existence of governments. But it is
      not demonstrated that kings and aristocracies will plunder the people,
      unless it be true that all men will plunder their neighbours if they can.
      Men are placed in very different situations. Some have all the bodily
      pleasures that they desire, and many other pleasures besides, without
      plundering anybody. Others can scarcely obtain their daily bread without
      plundering. It may be true, but surely it is not self-evident, that the
      former class is under as strong temptations to plunder as the latter. Mr.
      Mill was therefore bound <span class="pagenum">67</span><a
      name="link67_rdquo_________id_" id="link67_rdquo_________id_"></a>to prove
      it. That he has not proved it is one of thirty or forty fatal errors in
      his argument. It is not necessary that we should express an opinion or
      even have an opinion on the subject. Perhaps we are in a state of perfect
      scepticism: but what then? Are we the theory-makers? When we bring before
      the world a theory of government, it will be time to call upon us to offer
      proof at every step. At present we stand on our undoubted logical right.
      We concede nothing: and we deny nothing. We say to the Utilitarian
      theorists:&mdash;When you prove your doctrine, we will believe it; and,
      till you prove it, we will not believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bentham has quite misunderstood what we said about the French
      Revolution. We never alluded to that event for the purpose of proving that
      the poor were inclined to rob the rich. Mr. Mill&rsquo;s principles of
      human nature furnished us with that part of our argument ready-made. We
      alluded to the French Revolution for the purpose of illustrating the
      effects which general spoliation produces on society, not for the purpose
      of showing that general spoliation will take place under a democracy. We
      allowed distinctly that, in the peculiar circumstances of the French
      monarchy, the Revolution, though accompanied by a great shock to the
      institution of property, was a blessing. Surely Mr. Bentham will not
      maintain that the injury produced by the deluge of assignats and by the
      maximum fell only on the emigrants,&mdash;or that there were not many
      emigrants who would have staid and lived peaceably under any government if
      their persons and property had been secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      We never said that the French Revolution took place because the poor began
      to compare their cottages and salads with the hotels and banquets of the
      rich. <span class="pagenum">68</span><a name="link68" id="link68"></a>We
      were not speaking about <i>the causes</i> of the Revolution, or thinking
      about them. This we said, and say, that, if a democratic government had
      been established in France, the poor, when they began to compare their
      cottages and salads with the hotels and banquets of the rich, would, on
      the supposition that Mr. Mill&rsquo;s principles are sound, have plundered
      the rich, and repeated without provocation all the severities and
      confiscations which, at the time of the Revolution, were committed with
      provocation. We say that Mr. Mill&rsquo;s favourite form of government
      would, if his own views of human nature be just, make those violent
      convulsions and transfers of property which now rarely happen, except, as
      in the case of the French Revolution, when the people are maddened by
      oppression, events of annual or biennial occurrence. We gave no opinion of
      our own. We give none now. We say that this proposition may be proved from
      Mr. Mill&rsquo;s own premises, by steps strictly analogous to those by
      which he proves monarchy and aristocracy to be bad forms of government. To
      say this, is not to say that the proposition is true. For we hold both Mr.
      Mill&rsquo;s premises and his deduction to be unsound throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bentham challenges us to prove from history that the people will
      plunder the rich. What does history say to Mr. Mill&rsquo;s doctrine, that
      absolute kings will always plunder their subjects so unmercifully as to
      leave nothing but a bare subsistence to any except their own creatures? If
      experience is to be the test, Mr. Mill&rsquo;s theory is unsound. If Mr.
      Mill&rsquo;s reasoning <i>a priori</i> be sound, the people in a democracy
      will plunder the rich. Let us use one weight and one measure. Let us not
      throw history aside when we are proving a theory, and take it up again
      when we have to refute an objection founded on the principles of that
      theory. <span class="pagenum">69</span><a name="link69" id="link69"></a>We
      have not done, however, with Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s charges against us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Among other specimens of their ingenuity, they think they
      embarrass the subject by asking why, on the principles in question, women
      should not have votes as well as men. And why not? <br /><br /><span
      class="indent25">&lsquo;Gentle shepherd, tell me why.&mdash;&rsquo;
      </span></i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      If the mode of election was what it ought to be, there would be no more
      difficulty in women voting for a representative in Parliament than for a
      director at the India House. The world will find out at some time that the
      readiest way to secure justice on some points is to be just on all:&mdash;that
      the whole is easier to accomplish than the part; and that, whenever the
      camel is driven through the eye of the needle, it would be simple folly
      and debility that would leave a hoof behind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, says or sings Mr. Bentham, should not women vote? It may seem uncivil
      in us to turn a deaf ear to his Arcadian warblings. But we submit, with
      great deference, that it is not <i>our</i> business to tell him why. We
      fully agree with him that the principle of female suffrage is not so
      palpably absurd that a chain of reasoning ought to be pronounced unsound
      merely because it leads to female suffrage. We say that every argument
      which tells in favour of the universal suffrage of the males tells equally
      in favour of female suffrage. Mr. Mill, however, wishes to see all men
      vote, but says that it is unnecessary that women should vote: and for
      making this distinction <i>he</i> gives as a reason an assertion which, in
      the first place, is not true, and which, in the next place, would, if
      true, overset his whole theory of human nature; namely, that the interest
      of the women is identical with that of the men. We side with Mr. Bentham,
      so far at least as this: that, when we join to drive the camel through the
      needle, he shall go through hoof and all. We at present desire to be
      excused from <span class="pagenum">70</span><a name="link70" id="link70"></a>driving
      the camel. It is Mr. Mill who leaves the hoof behind. But we should think
      it uncourteous to reproach him in the language which Mr. Bentham, in the
      exercise of his paternal authority over the sect, thinks himself entitled
      to employ.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Another of their perverted ingenuities is, that &lsquo;they are
      rather inclined to think,&rsquo; that it would, on the whole, be for the
      interest of the majority to plunder the rich; and if so, the Utilitarians
      will say that the rich ought to be plundered. On which it is sufficient to
      reply, that for the majority to plunder the rich would amount to a
      declaration that nobody should be rich; which, as all men wish to be rich,
      would involve a suicide of hope. And as nobody has shown a fragment of
      reason why such a proceeding should be for the general happiness, it does
      not follow that the &lsquo;Utilitarians&rsquo; would recommend it. The
      Edinburgh Reviewers have a waiting gentlewoman&rsquo;s ideas of &lsquo;Utilitarianism.&rsquo;
      It is unsupported by anything but the pitiable &lsquo;We are rather
      inclined to think&rsquo;&mdash;and is utterly contradicted by the whole
      course of history and human experience besides,&mdash;that there is either
      danger or possibility of such a consummation as the majority agreeing on
      the plunder of the rich. There have been instances in human memory, of
      their agreeing to plunder rich oppressors, rich traitors, rich enemies,&mdash;but
      the rich simpliciter never. It is as true now as in the days of
      Harrington, that &lsquo;a people never will, nor ever can, never did, nor
      ever shall, take up arms for levelling.&rsquo; All the commotions in the
      world have been for something else; and &lsquo;levelling&rsquo; is brought
      forward as the blind to conceal what the other was</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We say, again and again, that we are on the defensive. We do not think it
      necessary to prove that a quack medicine is poison. Let the vendor prove
      it to be sanative. We do not pretend to show that universal suffrage is an
      evil. Let its advocates show it to be a good. Mr. Mill tells us that, if
      power be given for short terms to representatives elected by all the males
      of mature age, it will then be for the interest of those <span
      class="pagenum">71</span><a name="link71" id="link71"></a>representatives
      to promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number. To prove this,
      it is necessary that he should prove three propositions: first, that the
      interest of such a representative body will be identical with the interest
      of the constituent body; secondly, that the interest of the constituent
      body will be identical with that of the community; thirdly, that the
      interest of one generation of a community is identical with that of all
      succeeding generations. The two first propositions Mr. Mill attempts to
      prove, and fails. The last he does not even attempt to prove. We therefore
      refuse our assent to his conclusions. Is this unreasonable?
    </p>
    <p>
      We never even dreamed, what Mr. Bentham conceives us to have maintained,
      that it could be for the greatest happiness of <i>mankind</i> to plunder
      the rich. But we are &ldquo;rather inclined to think,&rdquo; though
      doubtingly and with a disposition to yield to conviction, that it may be
      for the pecuniary interest of the majority of a single generation in a
      thickly-peopled country to plunder the rich. Why we are inclined to think
      so we will explain, whenever we send a theory of government to an
      Encyclopaedia. At present we are bound to say only that we think so, and
      shall think so till somebody shows us a reason for thinking otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s answer to us is simple assertion. He must not think
      that we mean any discourtesy by meeting it with a simple denial. The fact
      is, that almost all the governments that have ever existed in the
      civilised world have been, in part at least, monarchical and
      aristocratical. The first government constituted on principles approaching
      to those which the Utilitarians hold was, we think, that of the United
      States. That the poor have never combined to plunder the rich in <span
      class="pagenum">72</span><a name="link72" id="link72"></a>the governments
      of the old world, no more proves that they might not combine to plunder
      the rich under a system of universal suffrage, than the fact that the
      English kings of the House of Brunswick have not been Neros and Domitians
      proves that sovereigns may safely be intrusted with absolute power. Of
      what the people would do in a state of perfect sovereignty we can judge
      only by indications, which, though rarely of much moment in themselves,
      and though always suppressed with little difficulty, are yet of great
      significance, and resemble those by which our domestic animals sometimes
      remind us that they are of kin with the fiercest monsters of the forest.
      It would not be wise to reason from the behaviour of a dog crouching under
      the lash, which is the case of the Italian people, or from the behaviour
      of a dog pampered with the best morsels of a plentiful kitchen, which is
      the case of the people of America, to the behaviour of a wolf, which is
      nothing but a dog run wild, after a week&rsquo;s fast among the snows of
      the Pyrenees. No commotion, says Mr. Bentham, was ever really produced by
      the wish of levelling: the wish has been put forward as a blind; but
      something else has been the real object. Grant all this. But why has
      levelling been put forward as a blind in times of commotion to conceal the
      real objects of the agitators? Is it with declarations which involve
      &ldquo;a suicide of hope&rdquo; that men attempt to allure others? Was
      famine, pestilence, slavery, ever held out to attract the people? If
      levelling has been made a pretence for disturbances, the argument against
      Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s doctrine is as strong as if it had been the real
      object of disturbances.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the great objection which Mr. Bentham makes to our review, still
      remains to be noticed:&mdash;<span class="pagenum">73</span><a
      name="link73" id="link73"></a>"The pith of the charge against the author
      of the Essays is, that he has written &lsquo;an elaborate Treatise on
      Government,&rsquo; and &lsquo;deduced the whole science from the
      assumption of certain propensities of human nature.&rsquo; Now, in the
      name of Sir Richard Birnie and all saints, from what else should it be
      deduced? What did ever anybody imagine to be the end, object, and design
      of government as it ought to be but the same operation, on an extended
      scale, which that meritorious chief magistrate conducts on a limited one
      at Bow-street; to wit, the preventing one man from injuring another?
      Imagine, then, that the Whiggery of Bow-street were to rise up against the
      proposition that their science was to be deduced from &lsquo;certain
      propensities of human nature,&rsquo; and thereon were to ratiocinate as
      follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>How then are we to arrive at just conclusions on a
      subject so &lsquo;important to the happiness of mankind? Surely by that
      method, which, in every experimental science to which it has been applied,
      has signally increased the power and knowledge of our species,&mdash;by
      that method for which our new philosopher! would substitute quibbles
      scarcely worthy of the barbarous respondents and opponents of the middle
      ages,&mdash;by the method of induction,&mdash;by observing the present
      state of the world,&mdash;by assiduously studying the history of past
      ages,&mdash;by sifting the evidence of facts,&mdash;by carefully combining
      and contrasting those which are authentic,&mdash;by generalising with
      judgment and diffidence,&mdash;by perpetually bringing the theory which we
      have constructed to the test of new facts,&mdash;by correcting, or
      altogether abandoning it, according as those new facts prove it to be
      partially or fundamentally unsound. Proceeding thus,&mdash;patiently,
      diligently, candidly, we may hope to form a system as far inferior in
      pretension to that which we have been examining, and as far superior to it
      in real utility, as the prescriptions of a great physician, varying with
      every stage of every malady, and with the constitution of every patient,
      to the pill of the advertising quack, which is to cure all human beings,
      in all climates, of all diseases.&rsquo;&rdquo; </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy now,&mdash;only fancy,&mdash;the delivery of these wise words
      at Bow-street; and think how speedily the practical catchpolls would
      reply, that all this might be very fine, but as far as they had studied
      history, the naked story was, after all, that numbers of men had a
      propensity to thieving, and their business was to catch them; that they,
      too, had been sifters of facts; and, to say the truth, their simple
      opinion was, that their brethren of the red <span class="pagenum">74</span><a
      name="link74_rdquo_________id_" id="link74_rdquo_________id_"></a>waistcoat&mdash;though
      they should be sorry to think ill of any man&mdash;had somehow contracted
      a leaning to the other side, and were more bent on puzzling the case for
      the benefit of the defendants, than on doing the duty of good officers and
      true. Such would, beyond all doubt, be the sentence passed on such
      trimmers in the microcosm of Bow-street. It might not absolutely follow
      that they were in a plot to rob the goldsmiths&rsquo; shops, or to set
      fire to the House of Commons; but it would be quite clear that they had
      got a feeling,&mdash;that they were in process of siding with the thieves,&mdash;and
      that it was not to them that any man must look who was anxious that
      pantries should be safe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This is all very witty; but it does not touch us. On the present occasion,
      we cannot but flatter ourselves that we bear a much greater resemblance to
      a practical catchpoll than either Mr. Mill or Mr. Bentham. It would, to be
      sure, be very absurd in a magistrate, discussing the arrangements of a
      police-office, to spout ill the style either of our article or Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s;
      but, in substance, he would proceed, if he were a man of sense, exactly as
      <i>we</i> recommend. He would, on being appointed to provide for the
      security of property in a town, study attentively the state of the town.
      He would learn at what places, at what times, and under what
      circumstances, theft and outrage were most frequent. Are the streets, he
      would ask, most infested with thieves at sunset or at midnight? Are there
      any public places of resort which give peculiar facilities to pickpockets?
      Are there any districts completely inhabited by a lawless population?
      Which are the flash-houses, and which the shops of receivers? Having made
      himself master of the facts he would act accordingly. A strong detachment
      of officers might be necessary for Petticoat Lane; another for the pit
      entrance of Covent Garden Theatre. Grosvenor Square and Hamilton Place
      would require little or no protection. <span class="pagenum">75</span><a
      name="link75" id="link75"></a>Exactly thus should we reason about
      government. Lombardy is oppressed by tyrants; and constitutional checks,
      such as may produce security to the people, are required. It is, so to
      speak, one of the resorts of thieves; and there is great need of
      police-officers. Denmark resembles one of those respectable streets in
      which it is scarcely necessary to station a catchpoll, because the
      inhabitants would at once join to seize a thief. Yet, even in such a
      street, we should wish to see an officer appear now and then, as his
      occasional superintendence would render the security more complete. And
      even Denmark, we think, would be better off under a constitutional form of
      government.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mill proceeds like a director of police, who, without asking a single
      question about the state of his district, should give his orders thus:&mdash;&ldquo;My
      maxim is, that every man will take what he can. Every man in London would
      be a thief, but for the thief-takers. This is an undeniable principle of
      human nature. Some of my predecessors have wasted their time in inquiring
      about particular pawnbrokers, and particular alehouses. Experience is
      altogether divided. Of people placed in exactly the same situation, I see
      that one steals, and that another would sooner burn his hand off. <i>Therefore</i>
      I trust to the laws of human nature alone, and pronounce all men thieves
      alike. Let every body, high and low, be watched. Let Townsend take
      particular care that the Duke of Wellington does not steal the silk
      handkerchief of the lord in waiting at the levee. A person has lost a
      watch. Go to Lord Fitz-william and search him for it; he is as great a
      receiver of stolen goods as Ikey Solomons himself. Don&rsquo;t tell me
      about his rank, and character, and fortune. He is a man; and a man does
      not change his nature <span class="pagenum">76</span><a name="link76"
      id="link76"></a>when he is called a lord. (1) Either men will steal or
      they will not steal. If they will not, why do I sit here? If they will,
      his lordship must be a thief.&rdquo; The Whiggery of Bow Street would
      perhaps rise up against this wisdom. Would Mr. Bentham think that the
      Whiggery of Bow Street was In the wrong?
    </p>
    <p>
      We blamed Mr. Mill for deducing his theory of government from the
      principles of human nature. &ldquo;In the name of Sir Richard Birnie and
      all saints,&rdquo; cries Mr. Bentham, &ldquo;from what else should it be
      deduced?&rdquo; In spite of this solemn adjuration, we shall venture to
      answer Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s question by another. How does he arrive at
      those principles of human nature from which he proposes to deduce the
      science of government? We think that we may venture to put an answer into
      his mouth; for in truth there is but one possible answer. He will say&mdash;By
      experience. But what is the extent of this experience? Is it an experience
      which includes experience of the conduct of men intrusted with the powers
      of government; or is it exclusive of that experience? If it includes
      experience of the manner in which men act when intrusted with the powers
      of government, then those principles of human nature from which the
      science of government is to be deduced can only be known after going
      through that inductive process by which we propose to arrive at the
      science of government. Our knowledge of human nature, instead of being
      prior in order to our knowledge
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) &ldquo;If Government is founded upon this, as a law of human
     nature, that a man, if able, will take from others anything
     which they have and he desires, it is sufficiently evident
     that when a man is called a king, he does not change his
     nature: so that, when he has power to take what he pleases,
     he will take what he pleases. To suppose that he will not,
     is to affirm that government is unnecessary, and that human
     beings will abstain from injuring one another of their own
     accord.&rdquo;&mdash;Mill. <i>on Government.</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">77</span><a name="link77" id="link77"></a> of the
      science of government, will be posterior to it. And it would be correct to
      say, that by means of the science of government, and of other kindred
      sciences&mdash;the science of education, for example, which falls under
      exactly the same principle&mdash;we arrive at the science of human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, on the other hand, we are to deduce the theory of government from
      principles of human nature, in arriving at which principles we have not
      taken into the account the manner in which men act when invested with the
      powers of government, then those principles must be defective. They have
      not been formed by a sufficiently copious induction. We are reasoning,
      from what a man does in one situation, to what he will do in another.
      Sometimes we may be quite justified in reasoning thus. When we have no
      means of acquiring information about the particular case before us, we are
      compelled to resort to cases which bear some resemblance to it. But the
      most satisfactory course is to obtain information about the particular
      case; and, whenever this can be obtained, it ought to be obtained. When
      first the yellow fever broke out, a physician might be justified in
      treating it as he had been accustomed to treat those complaints which, on
      the whole, had the most symptoms in common with it. But what should we
      think of a physician who should now tell us that he deduced his treatment
      of yellow fever from the general theory of pathology? Surely we should ask
      him, Whether, in constructing his theory of pathology, he had or had not
      taken into the account the facts which had been ascertained respecting the
      yellow fever? If he had, then it would be more correct to say that he had
      arrived at the principles of pathology partly by his experience of cases
      of yellow fever than <span class="pagenum">78</span><a
      name="link78_rdquo_________id_" id="link78_rdquo_________id_"></a>that he
      had deduced his treatment of yellow fever from the principles of
      pathology. If he had not, he should not prescribe for us. If we had the
      yellow fever, we should prefer a man who had never treated any cases but
      cases of yellow fever to a man who had walked the hospitals of London and
      Paris for years, but who knew nothing of our particular disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let Lord Bacon speak for us: &ldquo;Inductionem cense-mus cam esse
      demonstrandi formam, qu√¶ sensum tue-tur, et naturam promit, et operibus
      imminet, ac fere immiscetur. Itaque ordo quoque demonstrandi plane
      invertitur. Adhuc enim res ita geri consuevit, ut a sensu et
      particularibus primo loco ad maxime generalia advoletur, tanquam ad polos
      fixos, circa quos disputationes vertantur; ab illis c√¶tera, per media,
      deriventur; via certe compendiari√¢, sed pr√¶cipiti, et ad naturam
      im-pervi√¢, ad disputationes proclivi et accommodat√¢. At, secundum nos,
      axiomata continenter et gradatim exci-. tantur, ut non, nisi postremo
      loco, ad maxime generalia veniatur.&rdquo; Can any words more exactly
      describe the political reasonings of Mr. Mill than those in which Lord
      Bacon thus describes the logomachies of the schoolmen? Mr. Mill springs at
      once to a general principle of the widest extent, and from that general
      principle deduces syllogistically every thing which is included in it. We
      say with Bacon&mdash;&ldquo;non, nisi postremo loco, ad maxime generalia
      veniatur.&rdquo; In the present inquiry, the science of human nature is
      the &ldquo;maxime generale.&rdquo; To this the Utilitarian rushes at once,
      and from this he deduces a hundred sciences. But the true philosopher, the
      inductive reasoner, travels up to it slowly, through those hundred
      sciences, of which the science of government is one.

      As we have lying before us that incomparable volume, <span class="pagenum">79</span><a
      name="link79" id="link79"></a>the noblest and most useful of all the works
      of the human reason, the Novum Organum, we will transcribe a few lines, in
      which the Utilitarian philosophy is portrayed to the life.

      <i>&ldquo;Syllogismus act principia scientiarum non adhibetur, ad media

      objects of desire,&mdash;and the words of Bacon will seem to suit the
      current year as well as the beginning of the seventeenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have now gone through the objections that Mr. Bentham makes to our
      article: and we submit ourselves on all the charges to the judgment of the
      public.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s article consists of an exposition of the
      Utilitarian principle, or, as he decrees that it shall be called, the
      &ldquo;greatest happiness principle.&rdquo; He seems to think that we have
      been assailing it. We never said a syllable against it. We spoke
      slightingly of the Utilitarian sect, as we thought of them, and think of
      them; but it was not for holding this doctrine that we blamed them. In
      attacking them we no more meant to attack the &ldquo;greatest happiness&rdquo;
      <span class="pagenum">80</span><a name="link80" id="link80"></a>principle
      than when we say that Mahometanism is a false religion we mean to deny the
      unity of God, which is the first article of the Mahometan creed;&mdash;no
      more than Mr. Bentham, when he sneers at the Whigs, means to blame them
      for denying the divine right of kings. We reasoned throughout our article
      on the supposition that the end of government was to produce the greatest
      happiness to mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bentham gives an account of the manner In which he arrived at the
      discovery of the &ldquo;greatest happiness principle.&rdquo; He then
      proceeds to describe the effects which, as he conceives, that discovery is
      producing in language so rhetorical and ardent that, if it had been
      written by any other person, a genuine Utilitarian would certainly have
      thrown down the book in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The only rivals of any note to the new principle which were
      brought forward, were those known by the names of the &lsquo;moral sense,&rsquo;
      and the &lsquo;original contract.&rsquo; The new principle superseded the
      first of these, by presenting it with a guide for its decisions; and the
      other, by making it unnecessary to resort to a remote and imaginary
      contract for what was clearly the business of every man and every hour.
      Throughout the whole horizon of morals and of politics, the consequences
      were glorious and vast. It might be said without danger of exaggeration,
      that they who sat in darkness had seen a great light. The mists in which
      mankind had jousted against each other were swept away, as when the sun of
      astronomical science arose in the full development of the principle of
      gravitation. If the object of legislation was the greatest happiness,
      morality was the promotion of the same end by the conduct of the
      individual; and by analogy, the happiness of the world was the morality of
      nations. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;....All the sublime obscurities, which had haunted the mind of man
      from the first formation of society,&mdash;the phantoms whose steps had
      been on earth, and their heads among the clouds,&mdash;marshalled
      themselves at the sound of this new principle of connection and of union,
      and stood a regulated band, where all <span class="pagenum">81</span><a
      name="link81_rdquo_________id_" id="link81_rdquo_________id_"></a>was
      order, symmetry, and force. What men had struggled for and bled, while
      they saw it but as through a glass darkly, was made the object of
      substantial knowledge and lively apprehension. The bones of sages and of
      patriots stirred within their tombs, that what they dimly saw and followed
      had become the world&rsquo;s common heritage. And the great result was
      wrought by no supernatural means, nor produced by any unparallelable
      concatenation of events. It was foretold by no oracles, and ushered by no
      portents; but was brought about by the quiet and reiterated exercise of
      God&rsquo;s first gift of common sense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s discovery does not, as we think we shall be able to
      show, approach in importance to that of gravitation, to which he compares
      it. At all events, Mr. Bentham seems to us to act much as Sir Isaac Newton
      would have done if he had gone about boasting that he was the first person
      who taught bricklayers not to jump off scaffolds and break their legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does Mr. Bentham profess to hold out any new motive which may induce men
      to promote the happiness of the species to which they belong? Not at all.
      He distinctly admits that, if he is asked why government should attempt to
      produce the greatest possible happiness, he can give no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The real answer,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;appeared to be, that men
      at large ought not to allow a government to afflict them with move evil or
      less good than they can help. What a government ought to do is a
      mysterious and searching question, which those may answer who know what it
      means; but what other men ought to do is a question of no mystery at all.
      The word ought, if it means anything, must have reference to some kind of
      interest or motives; and what interest a government has in doing right,
      when it happens to be interested in doing wrong, is a question for the
      schoolmen. The fact appears to be, that ought is not predicable of
      governments. The question is not why governments are bound not to do this
      or that, but why other men should let them if they can help it. The point
      is not to determine why the lion should <span class="pagenum">82</span><a
      name="link82" id="link82"></a>not eat sheep, but why men should not eat
      their own mutton if they can</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The principle of Mr. Bentham, if we understand it, is this, that mankind
      ought to act so as to produce their greatest happiness. The word <i>ought</i>,
      he tells us, has no meaning, unless it be used with reference to some
      interest. But the interest of a man is synonymous with his greatest
      happiness:&mdash;and therefore to say that a man ought to do a thing, is
      to say that it is for his greatest happiness to do it. And to say that
      mankind <i>ought</i> to act so as to produce their greatest happiness, is
      to say that the greatest happiness is the greatest happiness&mdash;and
      this is all!
    </p>
    <p>
      Does Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s principle tend to make any man wish for anything
      for which he would not have wished, or do any thing which he would not
      have done, if the principle had never been heard of? If not, it is an
      utterly useless principle. Now, every man pursues his own happiness or
      interest&mdash;call it which you will. If his happiness coincides with the
      happiness of the species, then, whether he ever heard of the &ldquo;greatest
      happiness principle&rdquo; or not, he will, to the best of his knowledge
      and ability, attempt to produce the greatest happiness of the species.
      But, if what he thinks his happiness be inconsistent with the greatest
      happiness of mankind, will this new principle convert him to another frame
      of mind? Mr. Bentham himself allows, as we have seen, that he can give no
      reason why a man should promote the greatest happiness of others if their
      greatest happiness be inconsistent with what he thinks his own. We should
      very much like to know how the Utilitarian principle would run when
      reduced to one plain imperative proposition? Will it run thus&mdash;pursue
      <span class="pagenum">83</span><a name="link83" id="link83"></a>your own
      happiness? This is superfluous. Every man pursues it, according to his
      light, and always has pursued it, and always must pursue it. To say that a
      man has done any thing, is to say that he thought it for his happiness to
      do it. Will the principle run thus&mdash;pursue the greatest happiness of
      mankind, whether it be your own greatest happiness or not? This is absurd
      and impossible; and Bentham himself allows it to be so. But, if the
      principle be not stated in one of these two ways, we cannot imagine how it
      is to be stated at all. Stated in one of these ways, it is an identical
      proposition,&mdash;true, but utterly barren of consequences. Stated in the
      other way, it is a contradiction in terms. Mr. Bentham has distinctly
      declined the absurdity. Are we then to suppose that he adopts the truism?
    </p>
    <p>
      There are thus, it seems, two great truths which the Utilitarian
      philosophy is to communicate to mankind&mdash;two truths which are to
      produce a revolution in morals, in laws, in governments, in literature, in
      the whole system of life. The first of these is speculative; the second is
      practical. The speculative truth is, that the greatest happiness is the
      greatest happiness. The practical rule is very simple; for it imports
      merely that men should never omit, when they wish for any thing, to wish
      for it, or when they do any thing, to do it! It is a great comfort to us
      to think that we readily assented to the former of these great doctrines
      as soon as it was stated to us; and that we have long endeavoured, as far
      as human frailty would permit, to conform to the latter in our practice.
      We are, however, inclined to suspect that the calamities of the human race
      have been owing, less to their not knowing that happiness was happiness,
      than to their not knowing how to obtain it&mdash;less to their neglecting
      to do what they did, than to their not <span class="pagenum">84</span><a
      name="link84" id="link84"></a>being able to do what they wished, or not
      wishing to do what they ought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus frivolous, thus useless is this philosophy,&mdash;&ldquo;controversianun
      ferax, operiun effoeta, ad garriendum prompta, ad generandum invalida.&rdquo;
      (1) The humble mechanic who discovers some slight improvement in the
      construction of safety lamps or steam-vessels does more for the happiness
      of mankind than the &ldquo;magnificent principle,&rdquo; as Mr. Bentham
      calls it, will do in ten thousand years. The mechanic teaches us how we
      may in a small degree be better off than we were. The Utilitarian advises
      us with great pomp to be as well off as we can.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctrine of a moral sense may be very unphilosophical; but we do not
      think that it can be proved to be pernicious. Men did not entertain
      certain desires and aversions because they believed in a moral sense, but
      they gave the name of moral sense to a feeling which they found in their
      minds, however it came there. If they had given it no name at all it would
      still have influenced their actions; and it will not be very easy to
      demonstrate that it has influenced their actions the more because they
      have called it the moral sense. The theory of the original contract is a
      fiction, and a very absurd fiction; but in practice it meant, what the
      &ldquo;greatest happiness principle,&rdquo; if ever it becomes a watchword
      of political warfare, will mean&mdash;that is to say, whatever served the
      turn of those who used it. Both the one expression and the other sound
      very well in debating clubs; but in the real conflicts of life our
      passions and interests bid them stand aside and know their place. The
      &ldquo;greatest happiness principle&rdquo; has always been latent under
      the words, social contract, justice,
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">85</span><a name="link85" id="link85"></a>benevolence,
      patriotism, liberty, and so forth, just as for as it was for the
      happiness, real or imagined, of those who used these words to promote the
      greatest happiness of mankind. And of this we may be sure, that the words
      &ldquo;greatest happiness&rdquo; will never, in any man&rsquo;s mouth,
      mean more than the greatest happiness of others which is consistent with
      what he thinks his own. The project of mending a bad world by teaching
      people to give new names to old things reminds us of Walter Shandy&rsquo;s
      scheme for compensating the loss of his son&rsquo;s nose by christening
      him Trismegistus.
    </p>
    <p>
      What society wants is a new motive&mdash;not a new cant. If Mr. Bentham
      can find out any argument yet undiscovered which may induce men to pursue
      the general happiness, he will indeed be a great benefactor to our
      species. But those whose happiness is identical with the general happiness
      are even now promoting the general happiness to the very best of their
      power and knowledge: and Mr. Bentham himself confesses that he has no
      means of persuading those whose happiness is not identical with the
      general happiness to act upon his principle. Is not this, then, darkening
      counsel by words without knowledge? If the only fruit of the &ldquo;magnificent
      principle&rdquo; is to be, that the oppressors and pilferers of the next
      generation are to talk of seeking the greatest happiness of the greatest
      number, just as the same class of men have talked in our time of seeking
      to uphold the Protestant constitution&mdash;just as they talked under Anne
      of seeking the good of the Church, and under Cromwell of seeking the Lord&mdash;where
      is the gain? Is not every great question already enveloped in a
      sufficiently dark cloud of unmeaning words? Is it so difficult for a man
      to cant some one or more of the good old English cants which his <span
      class="pagenum">86</span><a name="link86" id="link86"></a>father and
      grandfather canted before him, that he must learn, in the schools of the
      Utilitarians, a new sleight of tongue, to make fools clap and wise men
      sneer? Let our countrymen keep their eyes on the neophytes of this sect,
      and see whether we turn out to be mistaken in the prediction which we now
      hazard. It will before long be found, we prophesy, that, as the corruption
      of a dunce is the generation of an Utilitarian, so is the corruption of an
      Utilitarian the generation of a jobber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most elevated station that the &ldquo;greatest happiness principle&rdquo;
      is ever likely to attain is this, that it may be a fashionable phrase
      among newspaper writers and members of parliament&mdash;that it may
      succeed to the dignity which has been enjoyed by the &ldquo;original
      contract,&rdquo; by the &ldquo;constitution of 1688,&rdquo; and other
      expressions of the same kind. We do not apprehend that it is a less
      flexible cant than those which have preceded it, or that it will less
      easily furnish a pretext for any design for which a pretext may be
      required. The &ldquo;original contract&rdquo; meant in the Convention
      Parliament the co-ordinate authority of the Three Estates. If there were
      to be a radical insurrection to-morrow, the &ldquo;original contract&rdquo;
      would stand just as well for annual parliaments and universal suffrage.
      The &ldquo;Glorious Constitution,&rdquo; again, has meant everything in
      turn: the Habeas Corpus Act, the Suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, the
      Test Act, the Repeal of the Test Act. There has not been for many years a
      single important measure which has not been unconstitutional with its
      opponents, and which its supporters have not maintained to be agreeable to
      the true spirit of the constitution. Is it easier to ascertain what is for
      the greatest happiness of the human race than what is the <span
      class="pagenum">87</span><a name="link87" id="link87"></a>constitution of
      England? If not, the greatest happiness principle will be what the &ldquo;principles
      of the constitution&rdquo; are, a thing to be appealed to by everybody,
      and understood by everybody in the sense which suits him best. It will
      mean cheap bread, dear bread, free trade, protecting duties, annual
      parliaments, septennial parliaments, universal suffrage, Old Sarum, trial
      by jury, martial law&mdash;everything, in short, good, bad, or
      indifferent, of which any person, from rapacity or from benevolence,
      chooses to undertake the defence. It will mean six-and-eightpence with the
      attorney, tithes at the rectory, and game-laws at the manor-house. The
      Statute of Uses, in appearance the most sweeping legislative reform in our
      history, was said to have produced no other effect than that of adding
      three words to a conveyance. The universal admission of Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s
      great principle would, as far as we can see, produce no other effect than
      that those orators who, while waiting for a meaning, gain time (like
      bankers paying in sixpences during a run) by uttering words that mean
      nothing would substitute &ldquo;the greatest happiness,&rdquo; or rather,
      as the longer phrase, the &ldquo;greatest happiness of the greatest
      number,&rdquo; for &ldquo;under existing circumstances,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;now
      that I am on my legs,&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;Mr. Speaker, I, for one, am
      free to say.&rdquo; In fact, principles of this sort resemble those forms
      which are sold by law-stationers, with blanks for the names of parties,
      and for the special circumstances of every case&mdash;mere customary
      headings and conclusions, which are equally at the command of the most
      honest and of the most unrighteous claimant. It is on the filling up that
      everything depends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;greatest happiness principle&rdquo; of Mr. Bentham is included
      in the Christian morality; and, to our <span class="pagenum">88</span><a
      name="link88" id="link88"></a>thinking, it is there exhibited in an
      infinitely more sound and philosophical form than in the Utilitarian
      speculations. For in the New Testament it is neither an identical
      proposition, nor a contradiction in terms; and, as laid down by Mr.
      Bentham, it must be either the one or the other. &ldquo;Do as you would be
      done by: Love your neighbour as yourself:&rdquo; these are the precepts of
      Jesus Christ. Understood in an enlarged sense, these precepts are, in
      fact, a direction to every man to promote the greatest happiness of the
      greatest number. But this direction would be utterly unmeaning, as it
      actually is in Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s philosophy, unless it were accompanied
      by a sanction. In the Christian scheme, accordingly, it is accompanied by
      a sanction of immense force. To a man whose greatest happiness in this
      world is inconsistent with the greatest happiness of the greatest number
      is held out the prospect of an infinite happiness hereafter, from which he
      excludes himself by wronging his fellow-creatures here.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is practical philosophy, as practical as that on which penal
      legislation is founded. A man is told to do something which otherwise he
      would not do, and is furnished with a new motive for doing it. Mr. Bentham
      has no new motive to furnish his disciples with. He has talents sufficient
      to effect any thing that can be effected. But to induce men to act without
      an inducement is too much, even for him. He should reflect that the whole
      vast world of morals cannot be moved unless the mover can obtain some
      stand for his engines beyond it. He acts as Archimedes would have done, if
      he had attempted to move the earth by a lever fixed on the earth. The
      action and reaction neutralise each other. The artist labours, and the
      world remains at rest. Mr. Bentham can only tell us to do something <span
      class="pagenum">89</span><a name="link89" id="link89"></a>which we have
      always been doing, and should still have continued to do, if we had never
      heard of the &ldquo;greatest happiness principle&rdquo;&mdash;or else to
      do something which we have no conceivable motive for doing, and therefore
      shall not do. Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s principle is at best no more than the
      golden rule of the Gospel without its sanction. Whatever evils, therefore,
      have existed in societies in which the authority of the Gospel is
      recognised may, <i>a fortiori</i>, as it appears to us, exist in societies
      in which the Utilitarian principle is recognised. We do not apprehend that
      it is more difficult for a tyrant or a persecutor to persuade himself and
      others that in putting to death those who oppose his power or differ from
      his opinions he is pursuing &ldquo;the greatest happiness,&rdquo; than
      that he is doing as he would be done by. But religion gives him a motive
      for doing as he would be done by: and Mr. Bentham furnishes him no motive
      to induce him to promote the general happiness. If, on the other hand, Mr.
      Bentham&rsquo;s principle mean only that every man should pursue his own
      greatest happiness, he merely asserts what everybody knows, and recommends
      what everybody does.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not upon this &ldquo;greatest happiness principle&rdquo; that the
      fame of Mr. Bentham will rest. He has not taught people to pursue their
      own happiness; for that they always did. He has not taught them to promote
      the happiness of others, at the expense of their own; for that they will
      not and cannot do. But he has taught them <i>how</i>, in some most
      important points, to promote their own happiness; and, if his school had
      emulated him as successfully in this respect as in the trick of passing
      off truisms for discoveries, the name of Benthamite would have been no
      word for the scoffer. But few of those who consider themselves as in a
      more especial <span class="pagenum">90</span><a name="link90" id="link90"></a>manner
      his followers have anything in common with him but his faults. The whole
      science of&rsquo; Jurisprudence is his. He has done much for political
      economy; but we are not aware that in either department any improvement
      has been made by members of his sect. He discovered truths; all that <i>they</i>
      have done has been to make those truths unpopular. He investigated the
      philosophy of law; he could teach them only to snarl at lawyers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We entertain no apprehensions of danger to the institutions of this
      country from the Utilitarians. Our fears are of a different kind. We dread
      the odium and discredit of their alliance. We wish to see a broad and
      clear line drawn between the judicious friends of practical reform and a
      sect which, having derived all its influence from the countenance which
      they have imprudently bestowed upon it, hates them with the deadly hatred
      of ingratitude. There is not, and we firmly believe that there never was,
      in this country a party so unpopular. They have already made the science
      of political economy&mdash;a science of vast importance to the welfare of
      nations&mdash;an object of disgust to the majority of the community. The
      question of parliamentary reform will share the same fate if once an
      association be formed in the public mind between Reform and
      Utilitarianism.
    </p>
    <p>
      We bear no enmity to any member of the sect; and for Mr. Bentham we
      entertain very high admiration. We know that among his followers there are
      some well-intentioned men, and some men of talents: but we cannot say that
      we think the logic on which they pride themselves likely to improve their
      heads, or the scheme of morality which they have adopted likely to improve
      their hearts. Their theory of morals, however,<span class="pagenum">91</span><a
      name="link91" id="link91"></a> well deserves an article to itself; and
      perhaps, on some future occasion, we may discuss it more fully than time
      and space at present allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preceding article was written, and was actually in types, when a
      letter from Mr. Bentham appeared in the newspapers, importing that,
      &ldquo;though he had furnished the Westminster Review with some <i>memoranda</i>
      respecting &lsquo;the greatest happiness principle,&rsquo; he had nothing
      to do with the remarks on our former article.&rdquo; We are truly happy to
      find that this illustrious man had so small a share in a performance
      which, for his sake, we have treated with far greater lenity than it
      deserved. The mistake, however, does not in the least affect any part of
      our arguments; and we have therefore thought it unnecessary to cancel or
      cast anew any of the foregoing pages. Indeed, we are not sorry that the
      world should see how respectfully we were disposed to treat a great man,
      even when we considered him as the author of a very weak and very unfair
      attack on ourselves. We wish, however, to intimate to the actual writer of
      that attack that our civilities were intended for the author of the
      &ldquo;Preuves Judiciaires,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Defence of Usury&rdquo;&mdash;and
      not for him. We cannot conclude, indeed, without expressing a wish&mdash;though
      we fear it has but little chance of reaching Mr. Bentham&mdash;that he
      would endeavour to find better editors for his compositions. If M. Dumont
      had not been a <i>r√©dacteur</i> of a different description from some of
      his successors, Mr. Bentham would never have attained the distinction of
      even giving his name to a sect.

      UTILITARIAN THEORY OF GOVERNMENT. (1)
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (<i>Edinburgh, Review</i>, October 1829.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e <span
      class="pagenum">92</span><a name="link92" id="link92"></a>have long been
      of opinion that the Utilitarians have owed all their influence to a mere
      delusion&mdash;that, while professing to have submitted their minds to an
      intellectual discipline of peculiar severity, to have discarded all
      sentimentality, and to have acquired consummate skill in the art of
      reasoning, they are decidedly inferior to the mass of educated men in the
      very qualities in which they conceive themselves to excel. They have
      undoubtedly freed themselves from the dominion of some absurd notions. But
      their struggle for intellectual emancipation has ended, as injudicious and
      violent struggles for political emancipation too often end, in a mere
      change of tyrants. Indeed, we are not sure that we do not prefer the
      venerable nonsense which holds prescriptive sway over the ultra-Tory to
      the upstart dynasty of prejudices and sophisms by which the revolutionists
      of the moral world have suffered themselves to be enslaved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Utilitarians have sometimes been abused as intolerant, arrogant,
      irreligious,&mdash;as enemies of literature, of the fine arts, and of the
      domestic charities.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) Westminster Review, (XXII. Art. 16,) on the Strictures
     of the Edinburgh Review (XCVIII. Art. 1) on the Utilitarian
     Theory of Government, and the &ldquo;Greatest Happiness
     Principle.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">93</span><a name="link93" id="link93"></a>They have
      been reviled for some things of which they were guilty, and for some of
      which they were innocent. But scarcely anybody seems to have perceived
      that almost all their peculiar faults arise from the utter want both of
      comprehensiveness and of precision in their mode of reasoning. We have,
      for some time past, been convinced that this was really the case; and
      that, whenever then philosophy should be boldly and unsparingly
      scrutinised, the world would see that it had been under a mistake
      respecting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have made the experiment; and it has succeeded far beyond our most
      sanguine expectations. A chosen champion of the School has come forth
      against us. A specimen of his logical abilities now lies before us; and we
      pledge ourselves to show that no prebendary at an anti-Catholic meeting,
      no true-blue baronet after the third bottle at a Pitt Club, ever displayed
      such utter incapacity of comprehending or answering an argument as appears
      in the speculations of this Utilitarian apostle; that he does not
      understand our meaning, or Mr. Mill&rsquo;s meaning, or Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s
      meaning, or his own meaning; and that the various parts of his system&mdash;if
      the name of system can be so misapplied&mdash;directly contradict each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having shown this, we intend to leave him in undisputed possession of
      whatever advantage he may derive from the last word. We propose only to
      convince the public that there is nothing in the far-famed logic of the
      Utilitarians of which any plain man has reason to be afraid; that this
      logic will impose on no man who dares to look it in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Westminster Reviewer begins by charging us with having misrepresented
      an important part of Mr. Mill&rsquo;s argument. <span class="pagenum">94</span><a
      name="link94" id="link94"></a>&ldquo;<i>The first extract given by the
      Edinburgh Reviewers from the essay was an insulated passage, purposely
      despoiled of what had preceded and what followed. The author had been
      observing, that &lsquo;some profound and benevolent investigators of human
      affairs had adopted the conclusion that, of all the possible forms of
      government, absolute monarchy is the best.&rsquo; This is what the
      reviewers have omitted at the beginning. He then adds, as in the extract,
      that &lsquo;Experience, if we look only at the outside of the facts,
      appears to be divided on this subject;&rsquo; there are Caligulas in one
      place, and kings of Denmark in another. &lsquo;As the surface of history
      affords, therefore, no certain principle of decision, we must go beyond
      the surface, and penetrate to the springs within.&rsquo; This is what the
      reviewers have omitted at the end</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is perfectly true that our quotation from Mr. Mill&rsquo;s essay was,
      like most other quotations, preceded and followed by something which we
      did not quote. But, if the Westminster Reviewer means to say that either
      what preceded or what followed would, if quoted, have shown that we put a
      wrong interpretation on the passage which was extracted, he does not
      understand Mr. Mill rightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mill undoubtedly says that, &ldquo;as the surface of history affords
      no certain principle of decision, we must go beyond the surface, and
      penetrate to the springs within.&rdquo; But these expressions will admit
      of several interpretations. In what sense, then, does Mr. Mill use them?
      If he means that we ought to inspect the facts with close attention, he
      means what is rational. But, if he means that we ought to leave the facts,
      with all their apparent inconsistencies, unexplained&mdash;to lay down a
      general principle of the widest extent, and to deduce doctrines from that
      principle by syllogistic argument, without pausing to consider whether
      those doctrines be or be not consistent with the facts,&mdash;then he
      means what is irrational; and this is clearly what he does mean: for he
      immediately begins, without offering <span class="pagenum">95</span><a
      name="link95" id="link95"></a>the least explanation of the contradictory
      appearances which he has himself described, to go beyond the surface in
      the following manner:&mdash;&ldquo;That one human being will desire to
      render the person and property of another subservient to his pleasures,
      notwithstanding the pain or loss of pleasure which it may occasion to that
      other individual, is the foundation of government.. The desire of the
      object implies the desire of the power necessary to accomplish the object.&rdquo;
      And thus he proceeds to deduce consequences directly inconsistent with
      what he has himself stated respecting the situation of the Danish people.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we assume that the object of government is the preservation of the
      persons and property of men, then we must hold that, wherever that object
      is attained, there the principle of good government exists. If that object
      be attained both in Denmark and in the United States of America, then that
      which makes government good must exist, under whatever disguise of title
      or name, both in Denmark and in the United States. If men lived in fear
      for their lives and their possessions under Nero and under the National
      Convention, it follows that the causes from which misgovernment proceeds
      existed both in the despotism of Rome and in the democracy of France.
      What, then, is that which, being found in Denmark and in the United
      States, and not being found in the Roman Empire or under the
      administration of Robespierre, renders governments, widely differing in
      their external form, practically good? Be it what it may, it certainly is
      not that which Mr. Mill proves <i>a priori</i> that it must be,&mdash;a
      democratic representative assembly. For the Danes have no such assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latent principle of good government ought to <span class="pagenum">96</span><a
      name="link96" id="link96"></a>be tracked, as it appears to us, in the same
      manner in which Lord Bacon proposed to track the principle of Heat. Make
      as large a list as possible, said that great man, of those bodies in
      which, however widely they differ from each other in appearance, we
      perceive heat; and as large a list as possible of those which, while they
      bear a general resemblance to hot bodies, are nevertheless not hot.
      Observe the different degrees of heat in different hot bodies; and then,
      if there be something which is found in all hot bodies, and of which the
      increase or diminution is always accompanied by an increase or diminution
      of heat, we may hope that we have really discovered the object of our
      search. In the same manner we ought to examine the constitution of all
      those communities in which, under whatever form, the blessings of good
      government are enjoyed; and to discover, if possible, in what they
      resemble each other, and in what they all differ from those societies in
      which the object of government is not attained. By proceeding thus we
      shall arrive, not indeed at a perfect theory of government, but at a
      theory which will be of great practical use, and which the experience of
      every successive generation will probably bring nearer and nearer to
      perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inconsistencies into which Mr. Mill has been betrayed by taking a
      different course ought to serve as a warning to all speculators. Because
      Denmark is well governed by a monarch who, in appearance at least, is
      absolute, Mr. Mill thinks that the only mode of arriving at the true
      principles of government is to deduce them <i>a priori</i> from the laws
      of human nature. And what conclusion does he bring out by this deduction?
      We will give it in his own words:&mdash;&ldquo;In the grand discovery of
      modern times, the system of representation, <span class="pagenum">97</span><a
      name="link97" id="link97"></a>the solution of all the difficulties, both
      speculative and practical, will perhaps be found. If it cannot, we seem to
      be forced upon the extraordinary conclusion that good government is
      impossible.&rdquo; That the Danes are well governed without a
      representation is a reason for deducing the theory of government from a
      general principle from which it necessarily follows that good government
      is impossible without a representation! We have done our best to put this
      question plainly; and we think that, if the Westminster Reviewer will read
      over what we have written twice or thrice with patience and attention,
      some glimpse of our meaning will break in even on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some objections follow, so frivolous and unfair, that we are almost
      ashamed to notice them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>When it was said that there was in Denmark a balanced contest
      between the king and the nobility, what was said was, that there was a
      balanced contest, but it did not last. It was balanced till something put
      an end to the balance; and so is everything else That such a balance will
      not last, is precisely what Mr. Mill had demonstrated</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mill, we positively affirm, pretends to demonstrate, not merely that a
      balanced contest between the king and the aristocracy will not last, but
      that the chances are as infinity to one against the existence of such a
      balanced contest. This is a mere question of fact. We quote the words of
      the essay, and defy the Westminster Reviewer to impeach our accuracy:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>It seems impossible that such equality should ever exist. How is
      it to be established? Or by what criterion is it to be ascertained? If
      there is no such criterion, it must, in all cases, be the result of
      chance. If so, the chances against it are as infinity to one</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reviewer has confounded the division of power <span class="pagenum">98</span><a
      name="link98" id="link98"></a>with the balance or equal division of power.
      Mr. Mill says that the division of power can never exist long, because it
      is next to impossible that the equal division of power should ever exist
      at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>When Mr. Mill asserted that it cannot be for the interest of
      either the monarchy or the aristocracy to combine with the democracy, it
      is plain he did not assert that if the monarchy and aristocracy were in
      doubtful contest with each other, they would not, either of them, accept
      of the assistance of the democracy. He spoke of their taking the side of
      the democracy; not of their allowing the democracy to take side with
      themselves</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Mill meant any thing, he must have meant this&mdash;that the
      monarchy and the aristocracy will never forget their enmity to the
      democracy in their enmity to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The monarchy and aristocracy,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;have all
      possible motives for endeavouring to obtain unlimited power over the
      persons and property of the community. The consequence is inevitable. They
      have all possible motives for combining to obtain that power, and unless
      the people have power enough to be a match for both they have no
      protection. The balance, therefore, is a thing the existence of which upon
      the best possible evidence is to be regarded as impossible</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Mill meant only what the Westminster Reviewer conceives him to have
      meant, his argument would leave the popular theory of the balance quite
      untouched. For it is the very theory of the balance that the help of the
      people will be solicited by the nobles when hard pressed by the king, and
      by the king when hard pressed by the nobles; and that, as the price of
      giving alternate support to the crown and the aristocracy, they will
      obtain something for themselves, as the Reviewer admits that they have
      done in Denmark. If Mr. Mill admits this, he admits the only theory of the
      balance of which we ever heard&mdash;that <span class="pagenum">99</span><a
      name="link99" id="link99"></a>very theory which he has declared to be wild
      and chimerical. If he denies it, he is at issue with the Westminster
      Reviewer as to the phenomena of the Danish government.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now come to a more important passage. Our opponent has discovered, as
      he conceives, a radical error which runs through our whole argument, and
      vitiates every part of it. We suspect that we shall spoil his triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mr. Mill never asserted &lsquo;that under no despotic government
      does any human being, except the tools of the sovereign possess more than
      the necessaries of life, and that the most intense degree of terror is
      kept up by constant cruelty.&rsquo; He said that absolute power leads to
      such results, &lsquo;by infallible sequence, where power over a community
      is attained, and nothing checks&rsquo; The critic on the Mount never made
      a more palpable misquotation. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spirit of this misquotation runs through every part of the
      reply of the Edinburgh Review that relates to the Essay on Government; and
      is repeated in as many shapes as the Roman pork. The whole description of
      &lsquo;Mr. Mill&rsquo;s argument against despotism,&rsquo;&mdash;including
      the illustration from right-angled triangles and the square of the
      hypothenuse,&mdash;is founded on this invention of saying what an author
      has not said, and leaving unsaid what he has.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We thought, and still think, for reasons which our readers will soon
      understand, that we represented Mr. Mill&rsquo;s principle quite fairly,
      and according to the rule of law and common sense, <i>ut res magis valeat
      guam pereat</i>. Let us, however, give him all the advantage of the
      explanation tendered by his advocate, and see what he will gain by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Utilitarian doctrine then is, not that despots and aristocracies will
      always plunder and oppress the people to the last point, but that they
      will do so if nothing checks them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, it is quite clear that the doctrine <span
      class="pagenum">100</span><a name="link100" id="link100"></a>thus stated
      is of no use at all, unless the force of the checks be estimated. The
      first law of motion is, that a ball once projected will fly on to all
      eternity with undiminished velocity, unless something checks. The fact is,
      that a ball stops in a few seconds after proceeding a few yards with very
      variable motion. Every man would wring his child&rsquo;s neck and pick his
      friend&rsquo;s pocket if nothing checked him. In fact, the principle thus
      stated means only that governments will oppress unless they abstain from
      oppressing. This is quite true, we own. But we might with equal propriety
      turn the maxim round, and lay it down, as the fundamental principle of
      government, that all rulers will govern well, unless some motive
      interferes to keep them from doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there be, as the Westminster Reviewer acknowledges, certain checks
      which, under political institutions the most arbitrary in seeming,
      sometimes produce good government, and almost always place some restraint
      on the rapacity and cruelty of the powerful, surely the knowledge of those
      checks, of their nature, and of their effect, must be a most important
      part of the science of government. Does Mr. Mill say any thing upon this
      part of the subject? Not one word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line of defence now taken by the Utilitarians evidently degrades Mr.
      Mill&rsquo;s theory of government from the rank which, till within the
      last few months, was claimed for it by the whole sect. It is no longer a
      practical system, fit to guide statesmen, but merely a barren exercise of
      the intellect, like those propositions in mechanics in which the effect of
      friction and of the resistance of the air is left out of the question; and
      which, therefore, though correctly deduced from the premises, are in
      practice utterly false. For, if Mr. <span class="pagenum">101</span><a
      name="link101" id="link101"></a>Mill professes to prove only that absolute
      monarchy and aristocracy are pernicious without checks,&mdash;if he allows
      that there are checks which produce good government even under absolute
      monarchs and aristocracies,&mdash;and if he omits to tell us what those
      checks are, and what effects they produce under different circumstances,&mdash;he
      surely gives us no information which can be of real utility.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fact is,&mdash;and it is most extraordinary that the Westminster
      Reviewer should not have perceived it,&mdash;that, if once the existence
      of checks on the abuse of power in monarchies and aristocracies be
      admitted, the whole of Mr. Milks theory falls to the ground at once. This
      is so palpable, that, in spite of the opinion of the Westminster Reviewer,
      we must acquit Mr. Mill of having intended to make such an admission. We
      still think that the words, &ldquo;where power over a community is
      attained, and nothing checks,&rdquo; must not be understood to mean that
      under a monarchical or aristocratical form of government there can really
      be any check which can in any degree mitigate the wretchedness of the
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all possible checks may be classed under two general heads,&mdash;want
      of will, and want of power. Now, if a king or an aristocracy, having the
      power to plunder and oppress the people, can want the will, all Mr. Mill&rsquo;s
      principles of human nature must be pronounced unsound. He tells us,
      &ldquo;that the desire to possess unlimited power of inflicting pain upon
      others, is an inseparable part of human nature;&rdquo; and that a &ldquo;chain
      of inference, close and strong to a most unusual degree,&rdquo; leads to
      the conclusion that those who possess this power will always desire to use
      it. It is plain, therefore, that, if Mr. Mill&rsquo;s principles be sound,
      the <span class="pagenum">102</span><a name="link102" id="link102"></a>check
      on a monarchical or an aristocratical government will not be the want of
      will to oppress.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a king or an aristocracy, having, as Mr. Mill tells us that they always
      must have, the will to oppress the people with the utmost severity, want
      the power, then the government, by whatever name it may be called, must be
      virtually a mixed government or a pure democracy: for it is quite clear
      that the people possess some power in the state&mdash;some means of
      influencing the nominal rulers. But Mr. Mill has demonstrated that no
      mixed government can possibly exist, or at least that such a government
      must come to a very speedy end; therefore, every country in which people
      not in the service of the government have, for any length of time, been
      permitted to accumulate more than the bare means of subsistence must be a
      pure democracy. That is to say, France before the revolution, and Ireland
      during the last century, were pure democracies. Prussia, Austria, Russia,
      all the governments of the civilised world, are pure democracies. If this
      be not a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, we do not know what is.
    </p>
    <p>
      The errors of Mr. Mill proceed principally from that radical vice in his
      reasoning which, in our last number, we described in the words of Lord
      Bacon. The Westminster Reviewer is unable to discover the meaning of our
      extracts from the <i>Novum Organum</i>, and expresses himself as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The quotations from Lord Bacon are misapplications, such as
      anybody may make to any thing he dislikes. There is no more resemblance
      between pain, pleasure, motives, &amp;c., and substantia, generation
      corrupting elementum, materia,&mdash;than between lines, angles,
      magnitudes, &amp;c., and the same</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It would perhaps be unreasonable to expect that a <span class="pagenum">103</span><a
      name="link103" id="link103"></a>writer who cannot understand his own
      English should understand Lord Bacon&rsquo;s Latin. We will therefore
      attempt to make our meaning clearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Lord Bacon blames in the schoolmen of his time is this,&mdash;that
      they reasoned syllogistically on words which had not been defined with
      precision; such as moist, dry, generation, corruption, and so forth. Mr.
      Mill&rsquo;s error is exactly of the same kind. He reasons syllogistically
      about power, pleasure, and pain, without attaching any definite notion to
      any one of those words. There is no more resemblance, says the Westminster
      Reviewer, between pain and substantia than between pain and a line or an
      angle. By his permission, in the very point to which Lord Bacon&rsquo;s
      observation applies, Mr. Mill&rsquo;s subjects do resemble the <i>substantia</i>
      and <i>elementum</i> of the schoolmen and differ from the lines and
      magnitudes of Euclid. We can reason <i>a priori</i> on mathematics,
      because we can define with an exactitude which precludes all possibility
      of confusion. If a mathematician were to admit the least laxity into his
      notions, if he were to allow himself to be deluded by the vague sense
      which words bear in popular use, or by the aspect of an ill-drawn diagram,
      if he were to forget in his reasonings that a point was indivisible, or
      that the definition of a line excluded breadth, there would be no end to
      his blunders. The schoolmen tried to reason mathematically about things
      which had not been, and perhaps could not be, defined with mathematical
      accuracy. We know the result. Mr. Mill has in our time attempted to do the
      same. He talks of power, for example, as if the meaning of the word power
      were as determinate as the meaning of the word circle. But, when we
      analyse his speculations, we find that his notion of power is, <span
      class="pagenum">104</span><a name="link104" id="link104"></a>in the words
      of Bacon, &ldquo;<i>phantastica et male terminata.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two senses in which we may use the word <i>power</i> and those
      words which denote the various distributions of power, as, for example, <i>monarchy</i>;&mdash;the
      one sense popular and superficial,&mdash;the other more, scientific and
      accurate. Mr. Mill, since he chose to reason <i>a priori</i>, ought to
      have clearly pointed out in which sense he intended to use words of this
      kind, and to have adhered inflexibly to the sense on which he fixed.
      Instead of doing this, he flies backwards and forwards from the one sense
      to the other, and brings out conclusions at last which suit neither.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of those two communities to which he has himself referred&mdash;the
      kingdom of Denmark and the empire of Rome&mdash;may serve to illustrate
      our meaning. Looking merely at the surface of things, we should call
      Denmark a despotic monarchy, and the Roman world, in the first century
      after Christ, an aristocratical republic. Caligula was, in theory, nothing
      more than a magistrate elected by the senate, and subject to the senate.
      That irresponsible dignity which, in the most limited monarchies of our
      time, is ascribed to the person of the sovereign never belonged to the
      earlier C√¶sars. The sentence of death which the great council of the
      commonwealth passed on Nero was strictly according to the theory of the
      constitution. Let, in fact, the power of the Roman emperors approached
      nearer to absolute dominion than that of any prince in modern Europe. On
      the other hand, the King of Denmark, in theory the most despotic of
      princes, would in practice find it most perilous to indulge in cruelty and
      licentiousness. Nor is there, we believe, at the present moment a single
      sovereign in our x <span class="pagenum">105</span><a
      name="link105_rdquo_________id_" id="link105_rdquo_________id_"></a>part
      of the world who has so much real power over the lives of his subjects as
      Robespierre, while he lodged at a Handler&rsquo;s and dined at a
      restaurateur&rsquo;s, exercised over the lives of those whom he called his
      fellow-citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mill and the Westminster Reviewer seem to agree that there cannot long
      exist in any society a division of power between a monarch, an
      aristocracy, and the people, or between any two of them. However the power
      be distributed, one of the three parties will, according to them,
      inevitably monopolise the whole. Now, what is here meant by power? If Mr.
      Mill speaks of the external semblance of power,&mdash;of power recognised
      by the theory of the constitution,&mdash;he is palpably wrong. In England,
      for example, we have had for ages the name and form of a mixed government,
      if nothing more. Indeed, Mr. Mill himself owns that there are appearances
      which have given colour to the theory of the balance, though he maintains
      that these appearances are delusive. But, if he uses the word power in a
      deeper and philosophical sense, he is, if possible, still more in the
      wrong than on the former supposition. For, if he had considered in what
      the power of one human being over other human beings must ultimately
      consist, he would have perceived, not only that there are mixed
      governments in the world, but that all the governments in the world, and
      all the governments which can even be conceived as existing in the world,
      are virtually mixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a king possessed the lamp of Aladdin,&mdash;if he governed by the help
      of a genius who carried away the daughters and wives of his subjects
      through the air to the royal <i>Parc-aux-cerfs</i>, and turned into stone
      every man who wagged a finger against his majesty&rsquo;s government,
      there would indeed be an unmixed despotism. <span class="pagenum">106</span><a
      name="link106" id="link106"></a>But, fortunately, a ruler can be gratified
      only by means of his subjects. His power depends on their obedience; and,
      as any three or four of them are more than a match for him by himself, he
      can only enforce the unwilling obedience of some by means of the willing
      obedience of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take any of those who are popularly called absolute princes&mdash;Napoleon
      for example. Could Napoleon have walked through Paris, cutting off the
      head of one person in every house which he passed? Certainly not without
      the assistance of an army. If not, why not? Because the people had
      sufficient physical power to resist him, and would have put forth that
      power in defence of their lives and of the lives of their children. In
      other words, there was a portion of power in the democracy under Napoleon.
      Napoleon might probably have indulged himself in such an atrocious freak
      of power if his army would have seconded him. But, if his army had taken
      part with the people, he would have found himself utterly helpless; and,
      even if they had obeyed his orders against the people, they would not have
      suffered him to decimate their own body. In other words, there was a
      portion of power in the hands of a minority of the people, that is to say,
      in the hands of an aristocracy, under the reign of Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      To come nearer home,&mdash;Mr. Mill tells us that it is a mistake to
      imagine that the English government is mixed. He holds, we suppose, with
      all the politicians of the Utilitarian school, that it is purely
      aristocratical. There certainly is an aristocracy in England; and we are
      afraid that their power is greater than it ought to be. They have power
      enough to keep up the game-laws and corn-laws; but they have not power
      enough to subject the bodies of men of the lowest class to wanton <span
      class="pagenum">107</span><a name="link107" id="link107"></a>outrage at
      their pleasure. Suppose that they were to make a law that any gentleman of
      two thousand a-year might have a day-labourer or a pauper flogged with a
      cat-of-nine-tails whenever the whim might take him. It is quite clear that
      the first day on which such flagellation should be administered would be
      the last day of the English aristocracy. In this point, and in many other
      points which might be named, the commonalty in our island enjoy a security
      quite as complete as if they exercised the right of universal suffrage. We
      say, therefore, that the English people have in their own hands a
      sufficient guarantee that in some points the aristocracy will conform to
      their wishes;&mdash;in other words, they have a certain portion of power
      over the aristocracy. Therefore the English government is mixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherever a king or an oligarchy refrains from the last extremity of
      rapacity and tyranny through fear of the resistance of the people, there
      the constitution, whatever it may be called, is in some measure
      democratical.
    </p>
    <p>
      The admixture of democratic power may be slight. It may be much slighter
      than it ought to be; but some admixture there is. Wherever a numerical
      minority, by means of superior wealth or intelligence, of political
      concert, or of military discipline, exercises a greater influence on the
      society than any other equal number of persons,&mdash;there, whatever the
      form of government may be called, a mixture of aristocracy does in fact
      exist. And, wherever a single man, from whatever cause, is so necessary to
      the community, or to any portion of it, that he possesses more power than
      any other man, there is a mixture of monarchy. This is the philosophical
      classification of governments: and if we use this classification we shall
      find, not only that <span class="pagenum">108</span><a
      name="link108_rdquo_________id_" id="link108_rdquo_________id_"></a>there
      are mixed governments, but that all governments are, and must always be,
      mixed. But we may safely challenge Mr. Mill to give any definition of
      power, or to make any classification of governments, which shall bear him
      ont in his assertion that a lasting division of authority is
      impracticable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is evidently on the real distribution of power, and not on names and
      badges, that the happiness of nations must depend. The representative
      system, though doubtless a great and precious discovery in politics, is
      only one of the many modes in which the democratic part of the community
      can efficiently check the governing few. That certain men have been chosen
      as deputies of the people,&mdash;that there is a piece of paper stating
      such deputies to possess certain powers,&mdash;these circumstances in
      themselves constitute no security for good government. Such a constitution
      nominally existed in France; while, in fact, an oligarchy of committees
      and clubs trampled at once on the electors and the elected. Representation
      is a very happy contrivance for enabling large bodies of men to exert
      their power with less risk of disorder than there would otherwise be. But,
      assuredly, it does not of itself give power. Unless a representative
      assembly is sure of being supported in the last resort by the physical
      strength of large masses who have spirit to defend the constitution and
      sense to defend it in concert, the mob of the town in which it meets may
      overawe it;&mdash;the howls of the listeners in its gallery may silence
      its deliberations;&mdash;an able and daring individual may dissolve it.
      And, if that sense and that spirit of which we speak be diffused through a
      society, then, even without a representative assembly, that society will
      enjoy many of the blessings of good government. <span class="pagenum">109</span><a
      name="link109" id="link109"></a>Which is the better able to defend himself
      as a strong man with nothing but his fists, or a paralytic cripple
      encumbered with a sword which he cannot lift? Such, we believe, is the
      difference between Denmark and some new republics in which the
      constitutional forms of the United States have been most sedulously
      imitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at the Long Parliament on the day on which Charles came to seize the
      five members: and look at it again on the day when Cromwell stamped with
      his foot on its floor. On which day was its apparent power the greater? On
      which day was its real power the less? Nominally subject, it was able to
      defy the sovereign. Nominally sovereign, it was turned out of doors by its
      servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constitutions are in politics what paper money is in commerce. They afford
      great facilities and conveniences. But we must not attribute to them that
      value which really belongs to what they represent. They are not power, but
      symbols of power, and will, in an emergency, prove altogether useless
      unless the power for which they stand be forthcoming. The real power by
      which the community is governed is made up of all the means which all its
      members possess of giving pleasure or pain to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great light may be thrown on the nature of a circulating medium by the
      phenomena of a state of barter. And in the same manner it may be useful to
      those who wish to comprehend the nature and operation of the outward signs
      of power to look at communities in which no such signs exist; for example,
      at the great community of nations. There we find nothing analogous to a
      constitution: but do we not find a government? We do in fact find
      government in its purest, and simplest, and most intelligible form. We see
      one portion <span class="pagenum">110</span><a name="link110" id="link110"></a>of
      power acting directly on another portion of power. We see a certain police
      kept up; the weak to a certain degree protected; the strong to a certain
      degree restrained. We see the principle of the balance in constant
      operation. We see the whole system sometimes undisturbed by any attempt at
      encroachment for twenty or thirty years at a time; and all this is
      produced without a legislative assembly, or an executive magistracy&mdash;without
      tribunals&mdash;without any code which deserves the name; solely by the
      mutual hopes and fears of the various members of the federation. In the
      community of nations, the first appeal is to physical force. In
      communities of men, forms of government serve to put off that appeal, and
      often render it unnecessary. But it is still open to the oppressed or the
      ambitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, we do not mean to deny that a form of government will, after it
      has existed for a long time, materially affect the real distribution of
      power throughout the community. This is because those who administer a
      government, with their dependents, form a compact and disciplined body,
      which, acting methodically and in concert, is more powerful than any other
      equally numerous body which is inferior in organisation. The power of
      rulers is not, as superficial observers sometimes seem to think, a thing
      <i>sui generis</i>. It is exactly similar in kind, though generally
      superior in amount, to that of any set of conspirators who plot to
      overthrow it. We have seen in our time the most extensive and the best
      organised conspiracy that ever existed&mdash;a conspiracy which possessed
      all the elements of real power in so great a degree that it was able to
      cope with a strong government, and to triumph over it&mdash;the Catholic
      Association. An Utilitarian <span class="pagenum">111</span><a
      name="link111" id="link111"></a>would tell us, we suppose, that the Irish
      Catholics had no portion of political power whatever on the first day of
      the late Session of Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us really go beyond the surface of facts: let us, in the sound sense
      of the words, penetrate to the springs within; and the deeper we go the
      more reason shall we find to smile at those theorists who hold that the
      sole hope of the human race is in a rule-of-three sum and a ballot-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must now return to the Westminster Reviewer. The following paragraph is
      an excellent specimen of his peculiar mode of understanding and answering
      arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The reply to the argument against &lsquo;saturation,&rsquo;
      supplies its own answer. The reason why it is of no use to try to &lsquo;saturate&rsquo;
      is precisely what the Edinburgh Reviewers have suggested,&mdash;&lsquo;that
      there is no limit to the number of thieves&rsquo; There are the thieves,
      and the thieves&rsquo; cousins,&mdash;with their men-servants, their
      maid-servants, and their little ones, to the fortieth generation. It is
      true, that &lsquo;a man cannot become a king or a member of the
      aristocracy whenever he chooses:&rsquo; but if there is to be no limit to
      the depredators except their own inclination to increase and multiply, the
      situation of those who are to suffer is as wretched as it needs be. It is
      impossible to define what are &lsquo;corporal pleasures.&rsquo; A Duchess
      of Cleveland was a &lsquo;corporal pleasure.&rsquo; The most disgraceful
      period in the history of any nation&mdash;that of the Restoration&mdash;presents
      an instance of the length to which it is possible to go in an attempt to
      &lsquo;saturate&rsquo; with pleasures of this kind.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To reason with such a writer is like talking to a deaf man who catches at
      a stray word, makes answer beside the mark, and is led further and further
      into error by every attempt to explain. Yet, that our readers may fully
      appreciate the abilities of the new philosophers, we shall take the
      trouble to go over some of our ground again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mill attempts to prove that there is no point of <span class="pagenum">112</span><a
      name="link112" id="link112"></a>saturation with the objects of human
      desire. He then takes it for granted that men have no objects of desire
      but those which can be obtained only at the expense of the happiness of
      others. Hence he infers that absolute monarchs and aristocracies will
      necessarily oppress and pillage the people to a frightful extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      We answered in substance thus. There are two kinds of objects of desire;
      those which give mere bodily pleasure, and those which please through the
      medium of associations. Objects of the former class, it is true, a man
      cannot obtain without depriving somebody else of a share. But then with
      these every man is soon satisfied. A king or an aristocracy cannot spend
      any very large portion of the national wealth on the mere pleasures of
      sense. With the pleasures which belong to us as reasoning and imaginative
      beings we are never satiated, it is true: but then, on the other hand,
      many of those pleasures can be obtained without injury to any person, and
      some of them can be obtained only by doing good to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Westminster Reviewer, in his former attack on us, laughed at us foil
      saying that a king or an aristocracy could not be easily satiated with the
      pleasures of sense, and asked why the same course was not tried with
      thieves. We were not a little surprised at so silly an objection from the
      pen, as we imagined, of Mr. Bentham. We returned, however, a very simple
      answer. There is no limit to the number of thieves. Any man who chooses
      can steal: but a man cannot become a member of the aristocracy or a king
      whenever he chooses. To satiate one thief, is to tempt twenty other people
      to steal. But by satiating one king or five hundred nobles with bodily
      pleasures we do not produce more kings or more nobles. The answer <span
      class="pagenum">113</span><a name="link113" id="link113"></a>of the
      Westminster Reviewer we have quoted above; and it will amply repay our
      readers for the trouble of examining it. We never read any passage which
      indicated notions so vague and confused. The number of the thieves, says
      our Utilitarian, is not limited. For there are the dependents and friends
      of the king and of the nobles. Is it possible that he should not perceive
      that this comes under a different head? The bodily pleasures which a man
      in power dispenses among his creatures are bodily pleasures as respects
      his creatures, no doubt. But the pleasure which he derives from bestowing
      them is not a bodily pleasure. It is one of those pleasures which belong
      to him as a reasoning and imaginative being. No man of common
      understanding can have failed to perceive that, when we said that a king
      or an aristocracy might easily be supplied to satiety with sensual
      Pleasures, we were speaking of sensual pleasures directly enjoyed by
      themselves. But &ldquo;it is impossible,&rdquo; says the Reviewer, &ldquo;to
      define what are corporal pleasures.&rdquo; Our brother would indeed, we
      suspect, find it a difficult task; nor, if we are to judge of his genius
      for classification from the specimen which immediately follows, would we
      advise him to make the attempt. &ldquo;A Duchess of Cleveland was a
      corporal pleasure.&rdquo; And to this wise remark is appended a note,
      setting forth that Charles the Second gave to the Duchess of Cleveland the
      money which he ought to have spent on the war with Holland. We scarcely
      know how to answer a man who unites so much pretension to so much
      ignorance. There are, among the many Utilitarians who talk about Hume,
      Condillac, and Hartley, a few who have read those writers. Let the
      Reviewer ask one of these what he thinks on the subject. We shall not
      undertake to whip <span class="pagenum">114</span><a name="link114"
      id="link114"></a>a pupil of so little promise through his first course of
      metaphysics. We shall, therefore, only say&mdash;leaving him to guess and
      wonder what we can mean&mdash;that, in our opinion, the Duchess of
      Cleveland was not a merely corporal pleasure,&mdash;that the feeling which
      leads a prince to prefer one woman to all others, and to lavish the wealth
      of kingdoms on her, is a feeling which can only be explained by the law of
      association.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we are tired, and even more ashamed than tired, of exposing these
      blunders. The whole article is of a piece. One passage, however, we must
      select, because it contains a very gross misrepresentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>They never alluded to the French Revolution for the purpose of
      proving that the poor were inclined to rob the rich.&rsquo; They only
      said, &lsquo;as soon as the poor again began to compare their cottages and
      salads with the hotels and banquets of the rich, there would have been
      another scramble for property, another general confiscation,&rsquo; &amp;c.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We said that, <i>if Mr. Mill&rsquo;s principles of human nature were
      correct</i>, there would have been another scramble for property, and
      another confiscation. We particularly pointed this out in our last
      article. We showed the Westminster Reviewer that he had misunderstood us.
      We dwelt particularly on the condition which was introduced into our
      statement. We said that we had not given, and did not mean to give, any
      opinion of our own. And, after this, the Westminster Reviewer thinks
      proper to repeat his former misrepresentation, without taking the least
      notice of that qualification to which we, in the most marked manner,
      called his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hasten on to the most curious part of the article under our
      consideration&mdash;the defence of the &ldquo;greatest happiness
      principle.&rdquo; The Reviewer charges us with having quite mistaken its
      nature. <span class="pagenum">115</span><a name="link115" id="link115"></a>&ldquo;<i>All
      that they |ave established is, that they do not understand it. Instead of
      the truism of the Whigs, &lsquo;that the greatest happiness is the
      greatest happiness,&rsquo; what Mr. Bentham had demonstrated, or at all
      events had laid Inch Inundations that there was no trouble in
      demonstrating, was, that the greatest happiness of the individual was in
      the long run to be obtained by pursuing the greatest happiness of the
      aggregate</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was distinctly admitted by the Westminster Reviewer, as we remarked in
      our last article, that he could give no answer to the question,&mdash;why
      governments should attempt to produce the greatest possible happiness? The
      Reviewer replies thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Nothing of the kind will be admitted at all. In the passage thus
      selected to be tacked to the other, the question started was, concerning
      &lsquo;the object of government;&rsquo; in which government was spoken of
      as an operation, not as anything that is capable of feeling pleasure or
      pain. In this sense it is true enough, that ought is not predicable of
      governments.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We will quote, once again, the passage which we quoted in our last Number;
      and we really hope that our brother critic will feel something like shame
      while he peruses it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The real answer appeared to be, that men at large ought not to
      allow a government to afflict them with more evil or less good, than they
      can help. What a government ought to do is a mysterious and searching
      question which those may answer who know what it means; but what other men
      ought to do is a question of no mystery at all. The word ought, if it
      means anything, must have reference to some kind of interest or motives;
      and what interest a government has in doing right, when it happens to be
      interested in doing wrong, is a question for the schoolmen. The fact
      appears to be that ought is not predicable of governments. The question is
      not, why governments are bound not to do this or that, but why other men
      should let them if they can help it. The point is not to determine why the
      lion should not eat sheep, but why men should not eat their own mutton if
      they can.</i>&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">116</span><a
      name="link116_rdquo_________id_" id="link116_rdquo_________id_"></a>We
      defy the Westminster Reviewer to reconcile this passage with the &ldquo;general
      happiness principle&rdquo; as he now states it. He tells us that he meant
      by government, not the people invested with the powers of government, but
      a mere <i>operation</i> incapable of feeling pleasure or pain. We say,
      that he meant the people invested with the powers of government, and
      nothing else. It is true that ought is not predicable of an operation. But
      who would ever dream of raising any question about the duties of an
      operation? What did the Reviewer mean by saying, that a government could
      not be interested in doing right because it was interested in doing wrong?
      Can an operation be interested in either? And what did he mean by his
      comparison about the lion? Is a lion an operation incapable of pain or
      pleasure? And what did he mean by the expression, &ldquo;other men,&rdquo;
      so obviously opposed to the word &ldquo;government&rdquo;? But let the
      public judge between us. It is superfluous to argue a point so clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reviewer does indeed seem to feel that his expressions cannot be
      explained away, and attempts to shuffle out of the difficulty by owning,
      that &ldquo;the double meaning of the word government was not got clear of
      without confusion.&rdquo; He has now, at all events, he assures us, made
      himself master of Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s philosophy. The real and genuine
      &ldquo;greatest happiness principle&rdquo; is, that the greatest happiness
      of every individual is identical with the greatest happiness of society;
      and all other &ldquo;greatest happiness principles&rdquo; whatever are
      counterfeits. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is the spirit of Mr.
      Bentham&rsquo;s principle; and if there is anything opposed to it in any
      former statement it may be corrected by the present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuredly, if a fair and honourable opponent had, <span class="pagenum">117</span><a
      name="link117" id="link117"></a>in discussing a question so abstruse as
      that concerning the origin of moral obligation, made some unguarded
      admission inconsistent with the spirit of his doctrines, we should not be
      inclined to triumph over him. But no tenderness is due to a writer who, in
      the very act of confessing his blunders, insults those by whom his
      blunders have been detected, and accuses them of misunderstanding what, in
      pet, he has himself mis-stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of this transaction illustrates excellently the real character
      of this sect. A paper comes forth, professing to contain a full
      developement of the &ldquo;greatest happiness principle,&rdquo; with the
      latest improvements of Mr. Bentham. The writer boasts that his article has
      the honour of being the announcement and the organ of this wonderful
      discovery, which is to make &ldquo;the bones of sages and patriots stir
      within their tombs.&rdquo; This &ldquo;magnificent principle&rdquo; is
      then stated thus: Mankind ought to pursue their greatest happiness. But
      there are persons whose interest is opposed to the greatest happiness of
      mankind. <i>Ought</i> is not predicable of such persons. For the word <i>ought</i>
      has no meaning unless it be used with reference to some interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We answered, with much more lenity than we should have shown to such
      nonsense, had it not proceeded, as we supposed, from Mr. Bentham, that
      interest was synonymous with greatest happiness; and that, therefore, if
      the word ought has no meaning, unless used with reference to interest,
      then, to say that mankind ought to pursue their greatest happiness, is
      simply to say, that the greatest happiness is the greatest happiness; that
      every individual pursues his own happiness; that either what he thinks is
      happiness must coincide with the greatest happiness of society or not;
      that, if what he thinks his happiness coincides with the greatest <span
      class="pagenum">118</span><a name="link118" id="link118"></a>happiness of
      society, he will attempt to promote the greatest happiness of society
      whether he ever heard of the &ldquo;greatest happiness principle&rdquo; or
      not; and that, by the admission of the Westminster Reviewer, if his
      happiness is inconsistent with the greatest happiness of society, there is
      no reason why he should promote the greatest happiness of society. Now,
      that there are individuals who think that for their happiness which is not
      for the greatest happiness of society is evident. The Westminster Reviewer
      allowed that some of these individuals were in the right; and did not
      pretend to give any reason which could induce any one of them to think
      himself in the wrong. So that the &ldquo;magnificent principle&rdquo;
      turned out to be, either a truism or a contradiction in terms; either this
      maxim&mdash;&ldquo;Do what you do;&rdquo; or this maxim, &ldquo;Do what
      you cannot do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Westminster Reviewer had the wit to see that he could not defend this
      palpable nonsense; but, instead of manfully owning that he had
      misunderstood the whole nature of the &ldquo;greatest happiness principle&rdquo;
      in the summer, and had obtained new light during the autumn, he attempts
      to withdraw the former principle unobserved, and to substitute another,
      directly opposed to it, in its place; clamouring all the time against our
      unfairness, like one who, while changing the carol diverts the attention
      of the table from his sleight of hand by vociferating charges of foul play
      against other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;greatest happiness principle&rdquo; for the present quarter is
      then this,&mdash;that every individual will best promote his own happiness
      in this world, religious considerations being left out of the question, by
      promoting the greatest happiness of the whole species. And this principle,
      we are told, holds good with respect to kings and aristocracies as well as
      with other people. <span class="pagenum">119</span><a name="link119"
      id="link119"></a>&ldquo;<i>It is certain that the individual operators in
      any government, if they were thoroughly intelligent and entered into a
      perfect calculation of all existing chances, would seek lor their own
      happiness in the promotion of the general; which brings them, if they knew
      it, under Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s rule. The mistake of supposing the contrary,
      lies in confounding criminals who have had the luck to escape punishment
      with those who have the risk still before them. Suppose, for instance, a
      member of the House of Commons were at this moment to debate within
      himself, whether it would be for his ultimate happiness to begin,
      according to his ability, to misgovern. If he could be sure of being as
      lucky as some that are dead and gone, there might be difficulty in finding
      him an answer. But he is not sure; and never can be, till he is dead. He
      does not know that he is not close upon the moment when misgovernment such
      as he is tempted to contemplate, will be made a terrible example of. It is
      not fair to pick out the instance of the thief that has died unhanged. The
      question is, whether thieving is at this moment an advisable trade to
      begin with all the possibilities of hanging not got over? This is the
      spirit of Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s principle; and if there is any thing opposed
      to it in any former statement, it may be corrected by the present</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We hope that we have now at last got to the real &ldquo;magnificent
      principle,&rdquo;&mdash;to the principle which is really to make &ldquo;the
      hones of the sages and patriots stir.&rdquo; What effect it may produce on
      the bones of the dead we shall not pretend to decide; but we are sure that
      it will do very little for the happiness of the living.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, nothing is more certain than this, that the
      Utilitarian theory of government, as developed in Mr. Mill&rsquo;s Essay
      and in all the other works on the subject which have been put forth by the
      sect, rests on these two principles,&mdash;that men follow their interest,
      and that the interest of individuals may be, and in fact perpetually is,
      opposed to the interest of society. Unless these two principles be
      granted, Mr. Mill&rsquo;s Essay does not contain one sound sentence. All
      his arguments <span class="pagenum">120</span><a name="link120"
      id="link120"></a>against monarchy and aristocracy, all his arguments in
      favour of democracy, nay, the very argument by which he shows that there
      is any necessity for having government at all, must be rejected as utterly
      worthless.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is so palpable that even the Westminster Reviewer, though not the
      most clear-sighted of men, could not help seeing it. Accordingly, he
      attempts to guard himself against the objection, after the manner of such
      reasoners, by committing two blunders instead of one. &ldquo;All this,&rdquo;
      says he, &ldquo;only shows that the members of a government would do well
      if they were all-wise;&rdquo; and he proceeds to tell us that, as rulers
      are not all-wise, they will invariably act against this principle wherever
      they can, so that the democratical checks will still be necessary to
      produce good government.
    </p>
    <p>
      No form which human folly takes is so richly and exquisitely laughable as
      the spectacle of an Utilitarian in a dilemma. What earthly good can there
      be in a principle upon which no man will act until he is allwise? A
      certain most important doctrine, we are told, has been demonstrated so
      clearly that it ought to be the foundation of the science of government.
      And yet the whole frame of government is to be constituted exactly as if
      this fundamental doctrine were false, and on the supposition that no human
      being will ever act as if he believed it to be true!
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole argument of the Utilitarians in favour of universal suffrage
      proceeds on the supposition that even the rudest and most uneducated men
      cannot, for any length of time, be deluded into acting against their own
      true interest. Yet now they tell us that, in all aristocratical
      communities, the higher and more educated class will, not occasionally,
      but invariably, act against <span class="pagenum">121</span><a
      name="link121" id="link121"></a>its own interest. Now, the only use of
      proving anything, as far as we can see, is that people may believe it. To
      say that a man does what he believes to be against his happiness is a
      contradiction in terms. If, therefore, government and laws are to be
      constituted on the supposition on which Mr. Mill&rsquo;s Essay is founded,
      that all individuals will, whenever they have power over others put into
      their hands, act in opposition to the general happiness, then government,
      and laws must be constituted on the supposition that no individual
      believes, or ever will believe, his own happiness to be identical with the
      happiness of society. That is to say, government and laws are to be
      constituted on the supposition that no human being will ever be satisfied
      by Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s proof of his &ldquo;greatest happiness principle,&rdquo;&mdash;a
      supposition which may be true enough, but which says little, we think, for
      the principle in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where has this principle been demonstrated? We are curious, we
      confess, to see this demonstration which is to change the face of the
      world and yet is to convince nobody. The most amusing circumstance is that
      the Westminster Reviewer himself does not seem to know whether the
      principle has been demonstrated or not. &ldquo;Mr. Bentham,&rdquo; he
      says, &ldquo;has demonstrated it, or at all events has laid such
      foundations that there is no trouble in demonstrating it.&rdquo; Surely it
      is rather strange that such a matter should be left in doubt. The Reviewer
      proposed, in his former article, a slight verbal emendation in the
      statement of the principle; he then announced that the principle had
      received its last improvement; and gloried in the circumstance that the
      Westminster Review had been selected as the organ of that improvement. Did
      it never occur to <span class="pagenum">122</span><a name="link122"
      id="link122"></a>him that one slight improvement to a doctrine is to prove
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bentham has not demonstrated the &ldquo;greatest happiness principle,&rdquo;
      as now stated. He is far too wise a man to think of demonstrating any such
      thing. In those sections of his <i>Introduction to the Principles of
      Morals and Legislation</i>, to which the Reviewer refers us in his note,
      there is not a word of the kind. Mr. Bentham says, most truly, that there
      are no occasions in which a man has not <i>some</i> motives for consulting
      the happiness of other men; and he proceeds to set forth what those
      motives are&mdash;sympathy on all occasions, and the love of reputation on
      most occasions. This is the very doctrine which we have been maintaining
      against Mr. Mill and the Westminster Reviewer. The principal charge which
      we brought against Mr. Mill was, that those motives to which Mr. Bentham
      ascribes so much influence were quite left out of consideration in his
      theory. The Westminster Reviewer, in the very article now before us,
      abuses us for saying, in the spirit, and almost in the words of Mr.
      Bentham, that &ldquo;there is a certain check to the rapacity and cruelty
      of men in their desire of the good opinion of others.&rdquo; But does this
      principle, in which we fully agree with Mr. Bentham, go the length of the
      new &ldquo;greatest happiness principle?&rdquo; The question is, not
      whether men have <i>some</i> motives for promoting the greatest happiness,
      but whether the <i>stronger</i> motives be those which impel them to
      promote the greatest happiness. That this would always be the case if men
      knew their own worldly interests is the assertion of the Reviewer. As he
      expresses some doubt whether Mr. Bentham has demonstrated this or not, we
      would advise him to set the point at rest by giving his own demonstration.
      <span class="pagenum">123</span><a name="link123" id="link123"></a>The
      Reviewer has not attempted to give a general confirmation of the &ldquo;greatest
      happiness principle;&rdquo; but he has tried to prove that it holds good
      in one or two particular cases. And even in those particular cases he has
      utterly failed. A man, says he, who calculated the chances fairly would
      perceive that it would be for his greatest happiness to abstain from
      stealing; for a thief runs a greater risk of being hanged than an honest
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been wise, we think, in the Westminster Reviewer, before he
      entered on a discussion of this sort, to settle in what human happiness
      consists. Each of the ancient sects of philosophy held some tenet on this
      subject which served for a distinguishing badge. The <i>summum bonum</i>
      of the Utilitarians, as far as we can Judge from the passage which we are
      now considering, is the not being hanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      That it is an unpleasant thing to be hanged, we most willingly concede to
      our brother. But that the whole question of happiness or misery resolves
      itself into this single point, we cannot so easily admit. We must look at
      the thing purchased as well as the price paid for it. A thief, assuredly,
      runs a greater risk of being hanged than a labourer; and so an officer in
      the army runs a greater risk of being shot than a banker&rsquo;s clerk;
      and a governor of India runs a greater risk of lying of cholera than a
      lord of the bedchamber. But does it therefore follow that every man,
      whatever his habits or feelings may be, would, if he knew his own
      happiness, become a clerk rather than a cornet, or goldstick in waiting
      rather than governor of India?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can be more absurd than to suppose, like the Westminster Reviewed
      that thieves steal only because they do not calculate the chances of being
      <span class="pagenum">124</span><a name="link124" id="link124"></a>hanged
      as correctly as honest men. It never seems to have occurred to him as
      possible that a man may so greatly prefer the life of a thief to the life
      of a labourer that he may determine to brave the risk of detection and
      punishment, though he may even think that risk greater than it really is.
      And how, on Utilitarian principles, is such a man to be convinced that he
      is in the wrong? &ldquo;You will be found out.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You
      will be hanged within two years.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I expect to be hanged
      within one year.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Then why do you pursue this lawless
      mode of life?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Because I would rather live for one year
      with plenty of money, dressed like a gentleman, eating and drinking of the
      best, frequenting public places, and visiting a dashing mistress, than
      break stones on the road, or sit down to the loom, with the certainty of
      attaining a good old age. It is my humour. Are you answered?&rdquo;
      &ldquo;A king, says the Reviewer again, would govern well, if he were
      wise, for fear of provoking his subjects to insurrection. Therefore, the
      true happiness of a king is identical with the greatest happiness of
      society. Tell Charles II. that, if he will be constant to his queen, sober
      at table, regular at prayers, frugal in his expenses, active in the
      transaction of business, if he will drive the herd of slaves, buffoons,
      and procurers from Whitehall, and make the happiness of his people the
      rule of his conduct, he will have a much greater chance of reigning in
      comfort to an advanced age; that his profusion and tyranny have
      exasperated his subjects, and may, perhaps, bring him to an end as
      terrible as his father&rsquo;s.&rdquo; He might answer, that he saw the
      danger, but that life was not worth having without ease and vicious
      pleasures. And what has our philosopher to say? Does he not see that it is
      no more possible to <span class="pagenum">125</span><a name="link125"
      id="link125"></a>reason a man out of liking a short life and a merry one
      more than a long life and a dull one than to reason a Greenlander out of
      his train oil? We may say that the tastes of the thief and the tyrant
      differ from ours; but what right have we to say, looking at this world
      alone, that they do not pursue their greatest happiness very judiciously?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the grossest ignorance of human nature to suppose that another man
      calculates the chances differently from us, merely because he does what,
      in his place, we should not do. Every man has tastes and propensities,
      which he is disposed to gratify at a risk and expense which people of
      different temperaments and habits think extravagant. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo;
      says Horace, &ldquo;does one brother like to lounge in the forum, to play
      in the Campus, and to anoint himself in the baths, so well, that he would
      not put himself out of his way for all the wealth of the richest
      plantations of the East; while the other toils from sunrise to sunset for
      the purpose of increasing his fortune?&rdquo; Horace attributes the
      diversity to the influence of the Genius and the natal star: and eighteen
      hundred years have taught us only to disguise our ignorance beneath a more
      philosophical language.
    </p>
    <p>
      We think, therefore, that the Westminster Reviewer, even if we admit his
      calculation of the chances to be right, does not make out his case. But he
      appears to us to miscalculate chances more grossly than any person who
      ever acted or speculated in this world. &ldquo;It is for the happiness,&rdquo;
      says he, &ldquo;of a member of the House of Commons to govern well; for he
      never can tell that he is not close on the moment when misgovernment will
      be terribly punished: if he was sure that he should be as lucky as his
      predecessors, it might be <span class="pagenum">126</span><a
      name="link126_rdquo_________id_" id="link126_rdquo_________id_"></a>for
      his happiness to misgovern; but he is not sure.&rdquo; Certainly a member
      of Parliament is not sure that he shall not be torn in pieces by a mob, or
      guillotined by a revolutionary tribunal for his opposition to reform. Nor
      is the Westminster Reviewer sure that he shall not be handed for writing
      in favour of universal suffrage.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may have democratical massacres. We may also have aristocratical
      proscriptions. It is not very likely, thank God, that we should see
      either. But the radical, we think, runs as much danger as the aristocrat.
      As to our friend the Westminster Reviewer, he, it must be owned, has as
      good a right as any man on his side, &ldquo;Antoni gladios conternnere.&rdquo;
      But take the man whose votes, ever since he has sate in Parliament, have
      been the most uniformly bad, and oppose him to the man whose votes have
      been the most uniformly good. The Westminster Reviewer would probably
      select Mr. Sadler and Mr. Hume. Now, does any rational man think,&mdash;will
      the Westminster Reviewer himself say,&mdash;that Mr. Sadler runs more risk
      of coming to a miserable end on account of his public conduct than Mr.
      Hume? Mr. Sadler does not know that he is not close on the moment when he
      will be made an example of; for Mr. Sadler knows, if possible, less about
      the future than about the past. But he has no more reason to expect that
      he shall be made an example of than to expect that London will be
      swallowed up by an earthquake next spring; and it would be as foolish in
      him to act on the former supposition as on the latter. There is a risk;
      for there is a risk of every thing which does not involve a contradiction;
      but it is a risk from which no man in his wits would give a shilling to be
      insured. Yet our Westminster Reviewer tells us that this risk alone, apart
      from all <span class="pagenum">127</span><a name="link127" id="link127"></a>considerations
      of religion, honour, or benevolence, would, as a matter of mere
      calculation, induce a wise member of the House of Commons to refuse any
      emoluments which might be offered him as the price of his support to
      pernicious measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have hitherto been examining cases proposed by our opponent. It is now
      our turn to propose one; and we beg that he will spare no wisdom in
      solving it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thief is condemned to be hanged. On the eve of the day fixed for the
      execution a turnkey enters his cell and tells him that all is safe, that
      he has only to slip out, that his friends are waiting in the neighbourhood
      with disguises, and that a passage is taken for him in an American packet.
      Now, it is clearly for the greatest happiness of society that the thief
      should be hanged and the corrupt turnkey exposed and punished. Will the
      Westminster Reviewer tell us that it is for the greatest happiness of the
      thief to summon the head jailer and tell the whole story? Now, either it
      is for the greatest happiness of a thief to be hanged or it is not. If it
      is, then the argument, by which the Westminster Reviewer attempts to prove
      that men do not promote their own happiness by thieving, falls to the
      ground. If it is not, then there are men whose greatest happiness is at
      variance with the greatest happiness of the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      To sum up our arguments shortly, we say that the &ldquo;greatest happiness
      principle,&rdquo; as now stated, is diametrically opposed to the principle
      stated in the Westminster Review three months ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      We say that, if the &ldquo;greatest happiness principle,&rdquo; as now
      stated, be sound, Mr. Mill&rsquo;s Essay, and all other works concerning
      Government which, like that Essay, proceed on the supposition that
      individuals may have <span class="pagenum">128</span><a name="link128"
      id="link128"></a>an interest opposed to the greatest happiness of society,
      are fundamentally erroneous.
    </p>
    <p>
      We say that those who hold this principle to be sound must be prepared to
      maintain, either that monarchs and aristocracies may be trusted to govern
      the community, or else that men cannot be trusted to follow their own
      interest when that interest is demonstrated to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We say that, if men cannot be trusted to follow their own interest when
      that interest has been demonstrated to them, then the Utilitarian
      arguments in favour of universal suffrage are good for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We say that the &ldquo;greatest happiness principle&rdquo; has not been
      proved; that it cannot be generally proved; that even in the particular
      cases selected by the Reviewer it is not clear that the principle is true;
      and that many cases might be stated in which the common sense of mankind
      would at once pronounce it to be false.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now leave the Westminster Reviewer to alter and amend his &ldquo;magnificent
      principle&rdquo; as he thinks best. Unlimited, it is false. Properly
      limited, it will be barren. The &ldquo;greatest happiness principle&rdquo;
      of the 1st of July, as far as we could discern its meaning through a cloud
      of rodomontade, was an idle truism. The &ldquo;greatest happiness
      principle&rdquo; of the 1st of October is, in the phrase of the American
      newspapers, &ldquo;important if true.&rdquo; But unhappily it is not true.
      It is not our business to conjecture what new maxim is to make the bones
      of sages and patriots stir on the 1st of December. We can only say that,
      unless it be something infinitely more ingenious than its two
      predecessors, we shall leave it unmolested. The Westminster Reviewer may,
      if he pleases, indulge himself like <span class="pagenum">129</span><a
      name="link129" id="link129"></a>Sultan Schahriar with espousing a rapid
      succession of virgin theories. But we must beg to be excused from playing
      the part of the vizier who regularly attended on the day after the wedding
      to strangle the new Sultana.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Westminster Reviewer charges us with urging it as an objection to the
      &ldquo;greatest happiness principle&rdquo; that &ldquo;it is included in
      the Christian morality.&rdquo; This is a mere fiction of his own. We never
      attacked the morality of the Gospel. We blamed the Utilitarians for
      claiming the credit of a discovery, when they had merely stolen that
      morality, and spoiled it in the stealing. They have taken the precept of
      Christ and left the motive; and they demand the praise of a most wonderful
      and beneficial invention, when all that they have done has been to make a
      most useful maxim useless by separating it from its sanction. On religious
      principles it is true that every individual will best promote his own
      happiness by promoting the happiness of others. But if religious
      considerations be left out of the question it is not true. If we do not
      reason on the supposition of a future state, where is the motive? If we do
      reason on that supposition, where is the discovery?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Westminster Reviewer tells us that &ldquo;we wish to see the science
      of Government unsettled because we see no prospect of a settlement which
      accords with our interests.&rdquo; His angry eagerness to have questions
      settled resembles that of a judge in one of Dryden&rsquo;s plays&mdash;the
      Amphitryon, we think&mdash;who wishes to decide a pause after hearing only
      one party, and, when he has been at last compelled to listen to the
      statement of the defendant, flies into a passion, and exclaims, &ldquo;There
      now, sir! See what you have done. The case was <span class="pagenum">130</span><a
      name="link130" id="link130"></a>quite dear a minute ago; and you must come
      and puzzle it!&rdquo; He is the zealot of a sect. We are searchers after
      truth. He wishes to have the question settled. We wish to have it sifted
      first. The querulous manner in which we have been blamed for attacking Mr.
      Mill&rsquo;s system, and propounding no system of our own, reminds us of
      the horror with which that shallow dogmatist, Epicurus, the worst parts of
      whose nonsense the Utilitarians have attempted to revive, shrank from the
      keen and searching scepticism of the second Academy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not our fault that an experimental science of vast extent does not
      admit of being settled by a short demonstration;&mdash;that the subtilty
      of nature, in the moral as in the physical world, triumphs over the
      subtilty of syllogism. The quack, who declares on affidavit that, by using
      his pills and attending to his printed directions, hundreds who had been
      dismissed incurable from the hospitals have renewed their youth like the
      eagles, may, perhaps, think that Sir Henry Halford, when he feels the
      pulses of patients, inquires about their symptoms, and prescribes a
      different remedy to each, is unsettling the science of medicine for the
      sake of a fee.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, in the course of this controversy, we have refrained from expressing
      any opinion respecting the political institutions of England, it is not
      because we have not an opinion or because we shrink from avowing it. The
      Utilitarians, indeed, conscious that their boasted theory of government
      would not bear investigation, were desirous to turn the dispute about Mr.
      Mill&rsquo;s Essay into a dispute about the Whig party, rotten boroughs,
      unpaid magistrates, and ex-officio informations. When we blamed them for
      talking nonsense. <span class="pagenum">131</span><a name="link131"
      id="link131"></a>they cried out that they were insulted for being
      reformers,&mdash;just as poor Ancient Pistol swore that the scars which he
      had received from the cudgel of Fluellen were got in the Gallia wars. We,
      however, did not think it desirable to mix up political questions, about
      which the public mind is violently agitated, with a great problem in moral
      philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our notions about Government are not, however, altogether unsettled. We
      have an opinion about parliamentary reform, though we have not arrived at
      that opinion by the royal road which Mr. Mill has opened for the explorers
      of political science. As we are taking leave, probably for the last time,
      of this controversy, we will state very concisely what our doctrines are.
      On some future occasion we may, perhaps, explain and defend them at
      length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our fervent wish, and we will add our sanguine hope, is that we may see
      such a reform of the House of Commons as may render its votes the express
      image of the opinion of the middle orders of Britain. A pecuniary
      qualification we think absolutely necessary; and, in settling its amount,
      our object would be to draw the line in such a manner that every decent
      farmer and shopkeeper might possess the elective franchise. We should wish
      to see an end put to all the advantages which particular forms of property
      possess over other forms, and particular portions of property over other
      equal portions. And this would content us. Such a reform would, according
      to Mr. Mill, establish an aristocracy of wealth, and leave the community
      without protection and exposed to all the evils of unbridled power. Most
      willingly would we stake the whole controversy between us on the success
      of the experiment which we propose.

      SOUTHEY&rsquo;S COLLOQUIES. (1)

      (<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, January 1830.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t <span
      class="pagenum">132</span><a name="link132" id="link132"></a>would be
      scarcely possible for a man of Mr. Southey&rsquo;s talents and
      acquirements to write two volumes so large as those before us, which
      should be wholly destitute of information and amusement. Yet we do not
      remember to have read with so little satisfaction any equal quantity of
      matter, written by any man of real abilities. We have, for some time past,
      observed with great regret the strange infatuation which leads the Poet
      Laureate to abandon those departments of literature in which he might
      excel, and to lecture the public on sciences of which he has still the
      very alphabet to learn. He has now, we think, done his worst. The subject
      which he has at last undertaken to treat is one which demands all the
      highest intellectual and moral qualities of a philosophical statesman, an
      understanding at once comprehensive and acute, a heart at once upright and
      charitable. Mr. Southey brings to the task two faculties which were never,
      we believe, vouchsafed in measure so copious to any human being, the

     (1) <i>Sir Thomas More; or, Colloquies on the Progress and
     Prospects of Society</i>. By Robert Southey, Esq., LL.D., Poet
     Laureate. 2 vols. 8vo, London: 1829.

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">133</span><a name="link133" id="link133"></a>It is,
      indeed, most extraordinary, that a mind like Mr. Southey&rsquo;s, a mind
      richly endowed in many respects by nature, and highly cultivated by study,
      a mind which has exercised considerable influence on the most enlightened
      generation of the most enlightened people that ever existed, should be
      utterly destitute of the power of discerning truth from falsehood. Yet
      such is the fact. Government is to Mr. Southey one of the fine arts. He
      judges of a theory, of a public measure, of a religion or a political
      party, of a peace or a war, as men judge of a picture or a statue, by the
      effect produced on his imagination. A chain of associations is to him what
      a chain of reasoning is to other men; and what he calls his opinions are
      in fact merely his tastes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This description might perhaps apply to a much greater man, Mr. Burke. But
      Mr. Burke assuredly possessed an understanding admirably fitted for the
      investigation of truth, an understanding stronger than that of any
      statesman, active or speculative, of the eighteenth century, stronger than
      every thing, except his own fierce and ungovernable sensibility. Hence he
      generally chose his side like a fanatic, and defended it like a
      philosopher. His conduct on the most important occasions of his life, at
      the time of the impeachment of Hastings for example, and at the time of
      the French Revolution, seems to have been prompted by those feelings and
      motives which Mr. Coleridge has so happily described, <br /><br /><span
      class="indent15">"Stormy pity, and the cherish&rsquo;d lure <br /><span
      class="indent15">Of pomp, and proud precipitance of soul.&rdquo; </span></span>

    <p>
      Hindostan, with its vast cities, its gorgeous pagodas, its infinite swarms
      of dusky population, its long-descended dynasties, its stately etiquette,
      excited in a mind so capacious, so imaginative, and so susceptible, <span
      class="pagenum">134</span><a name="link134" id="link134"></a>the most
      intense interest. The peculiarities of the costume, of the manners, and of
      the laws, the very mystery which hung over the language and origin of the
      people, seized his imagination. To plead under the ancient arches of
      Westminster Hall, in the name of the English people, at the bar of the
      English nobles, for great nations and kings separated from him by half the
      world, seemed to him the height of human glory. Again, it is not difficult
      to perceive that his hostility to the French Revolution principally arose
      from the vexation which he felt at having all his old political
      associations disturbed, at seeing the well known landmarks of states
      obliterated, and the li√¢mes and distinctions with which the history of
      Europe had been filled for ages at once swept away. He felt like an
      antiquary whose shield had been scoured, or a connoisseur who found his
      Titian retouched. But, however he came by an opinion, he had no sooner got
      it than he did his best to make out a legitimate title to it. His reason,
      like a spirit in the service of an enchanter, though spellbound, was still
      mighty. It did whatever work his passions and his imagination might
      impose. But it did that work, however arduous, with marvellous dexterity
      and vigour. His course was not determined by argument; but he could defend
      the wildest course by arguments more plausible than those by which common
      men support opinions which they have adopted after the fullest
      deliberation. Reason has scarcely ever displayed, even in those well
      constituted minds of which she occupies the throne, so much power and
      energy as in the lowest offices of that imperial servitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in the mind of Mr. Southey reason has no place at all, as either
      leader or follower, as either sovereign or slave. He does not seem to know
      what an <span class="pagenum">135</span><a name="link135" id="link135"></a>argument
      is. He never uses arguments himself. He never troubles himself to answer
      the arguments of his opponents. It has never occurred to him, that a man
      ought to be able to give some better account of the way in which he has
      arrived at his opinions than merely that it is his will and pleasure to
      hold them. It has never occurred to him that there is a difference between
      assertion and demonstration, that a rumour does not always prove a fact,
      that a single fact, when proved, is hardly foundation enough for a theory,
      that two contradictory propositions cannot be undeniable truths, that to
      beg the question is not the way to settle it, or that when an objection is
      raised, it ought to be met with something more convincing than &ldquo;scoundrel&rdquo;
      and &ldquo;blockhead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be absurd to read the works of such a writer for political
      instruction. The utmost that can be expected from any system promulgated
      by him is that it may be splendid and affecting, that it may suggest
      sublime and pleasing images. His scheme of philosophy is a mere day-dream,
      a poetical creation, like the Domdaniel cavern, the Swerga, or Padalon;
      and indeed it bears no inconsiderable resemblance to those gorgeous
      visions. Like them, it has something of invention, grandeur, and
      brilliancy. But, like them, it is grotesque and extravagant, and
      perpetually violates even that conventional probability which is essential
      to the effect of works of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warmest admirers of Mr. Southey will scarcely, we think, deny that his
      success has almost always borne an inverse proportion to the degree in
      which his undertakings have required a logical head. His poems, taken in
      the mass, stand far higher than his prose works. His official Odes indeed,
      amoung which the <span class="pagenum">136</span><a
      name="link136_rdquo_________id_" id="link136_rdquo_________id_"></a>Vision
      of Judgment must be classed, are, for the most part, worse than Pye&rsquo;s
      and as bad as Cibber&rsquo;s; nor do we think him generally happy in short
      pieces. But his longer poems, though full of faults, are nevertheless very
      extraordinary productions. We doubt greatly whether they will be read
      fifty years hence; but that, if they are read, they will be admired, we
      have no doubt whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, though in general we prefer Mr. Southey&rsquo;s poetry to his prose,
      we must make one exception. The Life of Nelson is, beyond all doubt, the
      most perfect and the most delightful of his works. The fact is, as his
      poems most abundantly prove, that he is by no means so skilful in
      designing as in filling up. It was therefore an advantage to him to be
      furnished with an outline of characters and events, and to have no other
      task to perform than that of touching the cold sketch into life. No
      writer, perhaps, ever lived, whose talents so precisely qualified him to
      write the history of the great naval warrior. There were no fine riddles
      of the human heart to read, no theories to propound, no hidden causes to
      develope, no remote consequences to predict. The character of the hero lay
      on the surface. The exploits were brilliant and picturesque. The necessity
      of adhering to the real course of events saved Mr. Southey from those
      faults which deform the original plan of almost every one of his poems,
      and which even his innumerable beauties of detail scarcely redeem. The
      subject did not require the exercise of those reasoning powers the want of
      which is the blemish of his prose. It would not be easy to find, in all
      literary history, an instance of a more exact hit between wind and water.
      John Wesley and the Peninsular War were subjects of a very different kind,
      subjects which required <span class="pagenum">137</span><a
      name="link137_rdquo_________id_" id="link137_rdquo_________id_"></a>all
      the qualities of a philosophic historian. In Mr. Southey&rsquo;s works on
      these subjects, he has, on the whole, failed. Yet there are charming
      specimens of the art of narration in both of them. The Life of Wesley will
      probably live. Defective as it is, it contains the only popular account of
      a most remarkable moral revolution, and of a man whose eloquence and
      logical acuteness might have made him eminent in literature, whose genius
      for government was not inferior to that of Richelieu, and who, whatever
      his errors may-have been, devoted all his powers, in defiance of obloquy
      and derision, to what he sincerely considered as the highest good of his
      species. The History of the Peninsular War is already dead: indeed, the
      second volume was dead-born. The glory of producing an imperishable record
      of that great conflict seems to be reserved for Colonel Napier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Book of the Church contains some stories very prettily told. The rest
      is mere rubbish. The adventure was manifestly one which could be achieved
      only by a profound thinker, and one in which even a profound thinker might
      have failed, unless his passions had been kept under strict control. But
      in all those works in which Mr. Southey has completely abandoned
      narration, and has undertaken to argue moral and political questions, his
      failure has been complete and ignominious. On such occasions his writings
      are rescued from utter contempt and derision solely by the beauty and
      purity of the English. We find, we confess, so great a charm in Mr.
      Southey&rsquo;s style that, even when he writes nonsense, we generally
      read it with pleasure, except indeed when he tries to be droll. A more
      insufferable jester never existed. He very often attempts to be humorous,
      and yet we do not remember a single <span class="pagenum">138</span><a
      name="link138" id="link138"></a>occasion on which he has succeeded farther
      than to be quaintly and flippantly dull. In one of his works he tells us
      that Bishop Spratt was very properly so called, inasmuch as he was a very
      small poet. And in the book now before us he cannot quote Francis Bugg,
      the renegade Quaker, without a remark on his unsavoury name. A wise man
      might talk folly like this by his own fireside; but that any human being,
      after having made such a joke, should write it down, and copy it out, and
      transmit it to the printer, and correct the proof-sheets, and send it
      forth into the world, is enough to make us ashamed of our species.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extraordinary bitterness of spirit which Mr. Southey manifests towards
      his opponents is, no doubt, in a great measure to be attributed to the
      manner in which he forms his opinions. Differences of taste, it has often
      been remarked, produce greater exasperation than differences on points of
      science. But this is not all. A peculiar austerity marks almost all Mr.
      Southey&rsquo;s judgments of men and actions. We are far from blaming him
      for fixing on a high standard of morals, and for applying that standard to
      every case. But rigour ought to be accompanied by discernment; and of
      discernment Mr. Southey seems to be utterly destitute. His mode of judging
      is monkish. It is exactly what we should expect from a stern old
      Benedictine, who had been preserved from many ordinary frailties by the
      restraints of his situation. No man out of a cloister ever wrote about
      love, for example, so coldly and at the same time so grossly. His
      descriptions of it are just what we should hear from a recluse who knew
      the passion only from the details of the confessional. Almost all his
      heroes make love either like Seraphim or like cattle. He seems to have no
      notion of <span class="pagenum">139</span><a name="link139" id="link139"></a>any
      thing between the Platonic passion of the Glendoveer who gazes with
      rapture on his mistress&rsquo;s leprosy, and the brutal appetite of
      Arvalan and Roderick. In Roderick, indeed, the two characters are united.
      He is first all clay, and then all spirit. He goes forth a Tarquin, and
      comes back too ethereal to be married. The only love scene, as far as we
      can recollect, in Madoc, consists of the delicate attentions which a
      savage, who has drunk too much of the Prince&rsquo;s excellent metheglin,
      offers to Goervyl. It would be the labour of a week to find, in all the
      vast mass of Mr. Southey&rsquo;s poetry, a single passage indicating any
      sympathy with those feelings which have consecrated the shades of Vaucluse
      and the locks of Meillerie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, if we except some very pleasing images of paternal tenderness and
      filial duty, there is scarcely any thing soft or humane in Mr. Southey&rsquo;s
      poetry. What theologians call the spiritual sins are his cardinal virtues,
      hatred, pride, and the insatiable thirst of vengeance. These passions he
      disguises under the name of duties; he purifies them from the alloy of
      vulgar interests; he ennobles them by uniting them with energy, fortitude,
      and a severe sanctity of manners; and he then holds them up to the
      admiration of mankind. This is the spirit of Thalaba, of Ladurlad, of
      Adosinda, of Roderick after his conversion. It is the spirit which, in all
      his writings, Mr. Southey appears to affect. &ldquo;I do well to be angry,&rdquo;
      seems to be the predominant feeling of his mind. Almost the only mark of
      charity which he vouchsafes to his opponents is to pray for their
      reformation; and this he does in terms not unlike those in which we can
      imagine a Portuguese priest interceding with Heaven for a Jew, delivered
      over to the secular arm after a relapse. <span class="pagenum">140</span><a
      name="link140" id="link140"></a>We have always heard, and fully believe,
      that Mr. Southey is a very amiable and humane man; nor do we intend to
      apply to him personally any of the remarks which we have made on the
      spirit of his writings. Such are the caprices of human nature. Even Uncle
      Toby troubled himself very little about the French grenadiers who fell on
      the glacis of Namur. And Mr. Southey, when he takes up his pen, changes
      his nature as much as Captain Shandy, when he girt on his sword. The only
      opponents to whom the Laureate gives quarter are those in whom he finds
      something of his own character reflected. He seems to have an instinctive
      antipathy for calm, moderate men, for men who shun extremes, and who
      render reasons. He has treated Mr. Owen of Lanark, for example, with
      infinitely more respect than he has shown to Mr. Hallam or to Dr. Lingard;
      and this for no reason that we can discover, except that Mr. Owen is more
      unreasonably and hopelessly in the wrong than any speculator of our time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Southey&rsquo;s political system is just what we might expect from a
      man who regards politics, not as matter of science, but as matter of taste
      and feeling. All his schemes of government have been inconsistent with
      themselves. In his youth he was a republican; yet, as he tells us in his
      preface to these Colloquies, he was even then opposed to the Catholic
      Claims. He is now a violent Ultra-Tory. Yet, while he maintains, with
      vehemence approaching to ferocity, all the sterner and harsher parts of
      the Ultra-Tory theory of government, the baser and dirtier part of that
      theory disgusts him. Exclusion, persecution, severe punishments for
      libellers and demagogues, proscriptions, massacres, civil war, if
      necessary, rather than any concession to a discontented people; these are
      the measures which <span class="pagenum">141</span><a
      name="link141_rdquo_________id_" id="link141_rdquo_________id_"></a>he
      seems inclined to recommend. A severe and gloomy tyranny, crushing
      opposition, silencing remonstrance, drilling the minds of the people into
      unreasoning obedience, has in it something of grandeur which delights his
      imagination. But there is nothing fine in the shabby tricks and jobs of
      office; and Mr. Southey, accordingly, has no toleration for them. When a
      Jacobin, he did not perceive that his system led logically, and would have
      led practically, to the removal of religious distinctions. He now commits
      a similar error. He renounces the abject and paltry part of the creed of
      his party, without perceiving that it is also an essential part of that
      creed. He would have tyranny and purity together; though the most
      superficial observation might have shown him that there can be no tyranny
      without corruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is high time, however, that we should proceed to the consideration of
      the work which is our more immediate subject, and which, indeed,
      illustrates in almost every page our general remarks on Mr. Southey&rsquo;s
      writings. In the preface, we are informed that the author, notwithstanding
      some statements to the contrary, was always opposed to the Catholic
      Claims. We fully believe this; both because we are sure that Mr. Southey
      is incapable of publishing a deliberate falsehood, and because his
      assertion is in itself probable. We should have expected that, even in his
      wildest paroxysms of democratic enthusiasm, Mr. Southey would have felt no
      wish to see a simple remedy applied to a great practical evil. We should
      have expected that, the only measure which all the great statesmen of two
      generations have agreed with each other in supporting would be the only
      measure which Mr. Southey would have agreed with himself in opposing. He
      has passed from <span class="pagenum">142</span><a
      name="link142_rdquo_________id_" id="link142_rdquo_________id_"></a>one
      extreme of political opinion to another, as Satan in Milton went round the
      globe, contriving constantly to &ldquo;ride with darkness.&rdquo; Wherever
      the thickest shadow of the night may at any moment chance to fall, there
      is Mr. Southey. It is not every body who could have so dexterously avoided
      blundering on the daylight in the course of a journey to the antipodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Southey has not been fortunate in the plan of any of his fictitious
      narratives. But he has never failed so conspicuously as in the work before
      us; except, indeed, in the wretched Vision of Judgment. In November, 1817,
      it seems the Laureate was sitting over his newspaper, and meditating about
      the death of the Princess Charlotte. An elderly person of very dignified
      aspect makes his appearance, announces himself as a stranger from a
      distant country, and apologizes very politely for not having provided
      himself with letters of introduction. Mr. Southey supposes his visitor to
      be some American gentleman who has come to see the lakes and the
      lake-poets, and accordingly proceeds to perform, with that grace, which
      only long practice can give, all the duties which authors owe to starers.
      He assures his guest that some of the most agreeable visits which he has
      received have been from Americans, and that he knows men among them whose
      talents and virtues would do honour to any country. In passing we may
      observe, to the honour of Mr. Southey, that, though he evidently has no
      liking for the American institutions, he never speaks of the people of the
      United States with that pitiful affectation of contempt by which some
      members of his party have done more than wars or tariffs can do to excite
      mutual enmity between two communities formed for mutual friendship. Great
      as the faults of his mind are, paltry spite <span class="pagenum">143</span><a
      name="link143" id="link143"></a>like this has no place in it. Indeed it is
      scarcely conceivable that a man of his sensibility and his imagination
      should look without pleasure and national pride on the vigorous and
      splendid youth of a great people, whose veins are filled with our blood,
      whose minds are nourished with our literature, and on whom is entailed the
      rich inheritance of our civilisation, our freedom, and our glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we must return to Mr. Southey&rsquo;s study at Keswick. The visitor
      informs the hospitable poet that he is not an American but a spirit. Mr.
      Southey, with more frankness than civility, tells him that he is a very
      queer one. The stranger holds out his hand. It has neither weight nor
      substance. Mr. Southey upon this becomes more serious; his hair stands on
      end; and he adjures the spectre to tell him what he is, and why he comes.
      The ghost turns out to be Sir Thomas More. The traces of martyrdom, it
      seems, are worn in the other world, as stars and ribands are worn in this.
      Sir Thomas shows the poet a red streak round his neck, brighter than a
      ruby, and informs him that Cranmer wears a suit of flames in paradise, the
      right hand glove, we suppose, of peculiar brilliancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas pays but a short visit on this occasion, but promises to
      cultivate the new acquaintance which he has formed, and, after begging
      that his visit may be kept secret from Mrs. Southey, vanishes into air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the book consists of conversations between Mr. Southey and the
      spirit about trade, currency, Catholic emancipation, periodical
      literature, female nunneries, butchers, snuff, book-stalls, and a hundred
      other subjects. Mr. Southey very hospitably takes an opportunity to escort
      the ghost round the lakes, and directs his attention to the most beautiful
      <span class="pagenum">144</span><a name="link144" id="link144"></a>points
      of view. Why a spirit was to be evoked for the purpose of talking over
      such matters and seeing such sights, why the vicar of the parish, a
      blue-stocking from London, or an American, such as Mr. Southey at first
      supposed the aerial visitor to be, might not have done as well, we are
      unable to conceive. Sir Thomas tells Mr. Southey nothing about future
      events, and indeed absolutely disclaims the gift of prescience. He has
      learned to talk modern English. He has read all the new publications, and
      loves a jest as well as when he jested with the executioner, though we
      cannot say that the quality of his wit has materially improved in
      Paradise. His powers of reasoning, too, are by no means in as great vigour
      as when he sate on the woolsack; and though he boasts that he is &ldquo;divested
      of all those passions which cloud the intellects and warp the
      understandings of men,&rdquo; we think him, we must confess, far less
      stoical than formerly. As to revelations, he tells Mr. Southey at the
      outset to expect none from him. The Laureate expresses some doubts, which
      assuredly will not raise him in the opinion of our modern millennarians,
      as to the divine authority of the Apocalypse. But the ghost preserves an
      impenetrable silence. As far as we remember, only one hint about the
      employment of disembodied spirits escapes him. He encourages Mr. Southey
      to hope that there is a Paradise Press, at which all the valuable
      publications of Mr. Murray and Mr. Colburn are reprinted as regularly as
      at Philadelphia; and delicately insinuates that Thalaba and the Curse of
      Kehama are among the number. What a contrast does this absurd fiction
      present to those charming narratives which Plato and Cicero prefixed to
      their dialogues! What cost in machinery, yet what poverty of effect! A
      ghost brought in <span class="pagenum">145</span><a
      name="link145_rdquo_________id_" id="link145_rdquo_________id_"></a>to say
      what any man might have said! The glorified spirit of a great statesman
      and philosophe! dawdling, like a bilious old nabob at a watering place,
      over quarterly reviews and novels, dropping in to pay long calls, making
      excursions in search of the picturesque! The scene of St. George and St.
      Dennis in the Pucelle is hardly more ridiculous. We know what Voltaire
      meant. Nobody, however, can suppose that Mr. Southey means to make game of
      the mysteries of a higher state of existence. The fact is that, in the
      work before us, in the Vision of Judgement, and in some of his other
      pieces, his mode of treating the most solemn subjects differs from that of
      open scoffers only as the extravagant representations of sacred persons
      and things in some grotesque Italian paintings differ from the caricatures
      which Carlile exposes in the front of his shop. We interpret the
      particular act by the general character. What in the window of a convicted
      blasphemer we call blasphemous, we call only absurd and ill judged in an
      altar-piece.

      We now come to the conversations which pass between Mr. Southey and Sir
      Thomas More, or rather between two Southeys, equally eloquent, equally
      angry, equally unreasonable, and equally given to talking about what they
      do not understand. (1) Perhaps we could not select a better instance of
      the spirit which pervades the whole book than the passages in which Mr.
      Southey gives his opinion of the manufacturing system. There is nothing
      which he hates so bitterly. It is, according to him, a system more
      tyrannical than that of the feudal ages, a system of actual servitude, a
      system which destroys the bodies and degrades the

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) A passage in which some expressions used by Mr. Southey
     were misrepresented, certainly without any unfair intention,
     has been here omitted.

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">146</span><a name="link146" id="link146"></a>minds
      of those who are engaged in it. He expresses a hope that the competition
      of other nations may drive us out of the field; that our foreign trade may
      decline; and that we may thus enjoy a restoration of national sanity and
      strength. But he seems to think that the extermination of the whole
      manufacturing population would be a blessing, if the evil could be removed
      in no other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Southey does not bring forward a single fact in support of these
      views; and, as it seems to us, there are facts which lead to a very
      different conclusion. In the first place, the poor-rate is very decidedly
      lower in the manufacturing than in the agricultural districts. If Mr.
      Southey will look over the Parliamentary returns on this subject, he will
      find that the amount of parochial relief required by the labourers in the
      different counties of England is almost exactly in inverse proportion to
      the degree in which the manufacturing system has been introduced into
      those counties. The returns for the years ending in March 1825, and in
      March 1828, are now before us. In the former year we find the poor-rate
      highest in Sussex, about twenty shillings to every inhabitant. Then come
      Buckinghamshire, Essex, Suffolk, Bedfordshire, Huntingdonshire, Kent, and
      Norfolk. In all these the rate is above fifteen shillings a head. We will
      not go through the whole. Even in Westmoreland and the North Riding of
      Yorkshire, the rate is at more than eight shillings. In Cumberland and
      Monmouthshire, the most fortunate of all the agricultural districts, it is
      at six shillings. But in the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is as low as
      five shillings; and when we come to Lancashire, we find it at four
      shillings, one fifth of what it is in Sussex. The returns of the year
      ending in March 1828 <span class="pagenum">147</span><a
      name="link147_rdquo_________id_" id="link147_rdquo_________id_"></a>are a
      little, and but a little, more unfavourable to the manufacturing
      districts. Lancashire, even in that season of distress, required a smaller
      poor-rate than any other district, and little more than one fourth of the
      poor-rate raised in Sussex. Cumberland alone, of the agricultural
      districts, was as well off as the West Riding of Yorkshire. These facts
      seem to indicate that the manufacturer is both in a more comfortable and
      in a less dependent situation than the agricultural labourer.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the effect of the manufacturing system on the bodily health, we must
      beg leave to estimate it by a standard far too low and vulgar for a mind
      so imaginative as that of Mr. Southey, the proportion of births and
      deaths. We know that, during the growth of this atrocious system, this new
      misery, to use the phrases of Mr. Southey, this new enormity, this birth
      of a portentous age, this pest which no man can approve whose heart is not
      seared or whose understanding has not been darkened, there has been a
      great diminution of mortality, and that this diminution has been greater
      in the manufacturing towns than any where else. The mortality still is, as
      it always was, greater in towns than in the country. But the difference
      has diminished in an extraordinary degree. There is the best reason to
      believe that the annual mortality of Manchester, about the middle of the
      last century, was one in twenty-eight. It is now reckoned at one in
      forty-five. In Glasgow and Leeds a similar improvement has taken place.
      Nay, the rate of mortality in those three great capitals of the
      manufacturing districts is now considerably less than it was, fifty years
      ago, over England and Wales taken together, open country and all. We might
      with some plausibility maintain that the people <span class="pagenum">148</span><a
      name="link148" id="link148"></a>live longer because they are better fed,
      better lodged, better clothed, and better attended in sickness, and that
      these improvements are owing to that increase of national wealth which the
      manufacturing system has produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much more might be said on the subject. But to what end? It is not from
      bills of mortality and statistical tables that Mr. Southey has learned his
      political creed. He cannot stoop to study the history of the system which
      he abuses, to strike the balance between the good and evil which it has
      produced, to compare district with district, or generation with
      generation. We will give his own reason for his opinion, the only reason
      which he gives for it, in his own words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>We remained awhile in silence looking upon the assemblage of
      dwellings below. Here, and in the adjoining hamlet of Millbeck, the
      effects of manufactures and of agriculture may be seen and compared. The
      old cottages are such as the poet and the painter especially delight in
      beholding. Substantially built of the native stone without mortar, dirtied
      with no white lime, and their long low roofs covered with slate, if they
      had been raised by the magic of some indigenous Amphion&rsquo;s music, the
      materials could not have adjusted themselves more beautifully in accord
      with the surrounding scene; and time has still further harmonized them
      with weather-stains, lichens, and moss, short grasses, and short fern, and
      stone-plants of various kinds. The ornamented chimneys, round or square,
      less adorned than those which, like little turrets, crest the houses of
      the Portuguese peasantry; and yet not less happily suited to their place,
      the hedge of dipt box beneath the windows, the rose-bushes beside the
      door, the little patch of flower-ground, with its tall holly-hocks in
      front; the garden beside, the bee-hives, and the orchard with its bank of
      daffodils and snow-drops, the earliest and the profusest in these parts,
      indicate in the owners some portion of ease and leisure, some regard to
      neatness and comfort, some sense of natural, and innocent, and healthful
      enjoyment. The new cottages of the manufacturers are upon the
      manufacturing pattern&mdash;naked, and in a row.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">149</span><a name="link149" id="link149"></a>"&lsquo;<i>How
      is it,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that every thing which is connected with
      manufactures presents such features of unqualified deformity? From the
      largest of Mammon&rsquo;s temples down to the poorest hovel in which his
      helotry are stalled, these edifices have all one character. Time will not
      mellow them; nature will neither clothe nor conceal them; and they will
      remain always as offensive to the eye as to the mind</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is wisdom. Here are the principles on which nations are to be
      governed. Rose-bushes and poor-rates, rather than steam-engines and
      independence. Mortality and cottages with weather-stains, rather than
      health and long life with edifices which time cannot mellow. We are told,
      that our age has invented atrocities beyond the imagination of our
      fathers; that society has been brought into a state compared with which
      extermination would be a blessing; and all because the dwellings of
      cotton-spinners are naked and rectangular. Mr. Southey has found out a
      way, he tells us, in which the effects of manufactures and agriculture may
      be compared. And what is this way? To stand on a hill, to look at a
      cottage and a factory, and to see which is the prettier. Does air. Southey
      think that the body of the English peasantry live, or ever lived, in
      substantial or ornamented cottages, with box-hedges, flower-gardens,
      bee-hives, and orchards? If not, what is his parallel worth? We despise
      those mock philosophers, who think that they serve the cause of science by
      depreciating literature and the fine arts. But if any thing could excuse
      their narrowness of mind it would be such a book as this. It is not
      strange that, when one enthusiast makes the picturesque the test of
      political good, another should feel inclined to proscribe altogether the
      pleasures of taste and imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it is that Mr. Southey reasons about matters <span class="pagenum">150</span><a
      name="link150" id="link150"></a>with which he thinks himself perfectly
      conversant. We cannot, therefore, be surprised to find that he commits
      extraordinary blunders when he writes on points of which he acknowledges
      himself to be ignorant. He confesses that he is not versed in political
      economy, and that he has neither liking nor aptitude for it; and he then
      proceeds to read the public a lecture concerning it which fully bears out
      his confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All wealth,&rdquo; says Sir Thomas More, &ldquo;in former times was
      tangible. It consisted in land, money, or chattels, which were either of
      real or conventional value.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Montesinos, as Mr. Southey somewhat affectedly calls himself, answers
      thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jewels, for example, and pictures, as in Holland, where indeed at
      one time tulip bulbs answered the same purpose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That bubble,&rdquo; says Sir Thomas, &ldquo;was one of those
      contagious insanities to which communities are subject. All wealth was
      real, till the extent of commerce rendered a paper currency necessary;
      which differed from precious stones and pictures in this important point,
      that there was no limit to its production.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We regard it,&rdquo; says Montesinos, &ldquo;as the representative
      of real wealth; and, therefore, limited always to the amount of what it
      represents.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pursue that notion,&rdquo; answers the ghost, &ldquo;and you will
      be in the dark presently. Your provincial banknotes, which constitute
      almost wholly the circulating medium of certain districts, pass current
      to-day. Tomorrow tidings may come that the house which issued them has
      stopt payment, and what do they represent then? You will find them the
      shadow of a shade.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">151</span><a name="link151"
      id="link151"></a>We scarcely know at which end to begin to disentangle
      this knot of absurdities. We might ask, why it should be a greater proof
      of insanity in men to set a high value on rare tulips than on rare stones,
      which are neither more useful nor more beautiful? We might ask how it can
      be said that there is no limit to the production of paper money, when a
      man is hanged if he issues any in the name of another, and is forced to
      cash what he issues in his own? But Mr. Southey&rsquo;s error lies deeper
      still. &ldquo;All wealth,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;was tangible and real
      till paper currency was introduced.&rdquo; Now, was there ever, since men
      emerged from a state of utter barbarism, an age in which there were no
      debts? Is not a debt, while the solvency of the debtor is undoubted,
      always reckoned as part of the wealth of the creditor? Yet is it tangible
      and real wealth? Does it cease to be wealth, because there is the security
      of a written acknowledgment for it? And what else is paper currency? Did
      Mr. Southey ever read a bank-note? If he did, he would see that it is a
      written acknowledgment of a debt, and a promise to pay that debt. The
      promise may be violated: the debt may remain unpaid: those to whom it was
      due may suffer: but this is a risk not confined to cases of paper
      currency: it is a risk inseparable from the relation of debtor and
      creditor. Every man who sells goods for any thing but ready money runs the
      risk of finding that what he considered as part of his wealth one day is
      nothing at all the next day. Mr. Southey refers to the picture-galleries
      of Holland. The pictures were undoubtedly real and tangible possessions.
      But surely it might happen that a burgomaster might owe a picture-dealer a
      thousand guilders for a Teniers. What in this case corresponds to our
      paper money is not the <span class="pagenum">152</span><a name="link152"
      id="link152"></a>picture, which is tangible, but the claim of the
      picture-dealer on his customer for the price of the picture; and this
      claim is not tangible. Now, would not the picture-dealer consider this
      claim as part of his wealth? Would not a tradesman who knew of the claim
      give credit to the picture-dealer the more readily on account of the
      claim? The burgomaster might be ruined. If so, would not those
      consequences follow which, as Mr. Southey tells us, were never heard of
      till paper money came into use? Yesterday this claim was worth a thousand
      guilders. To-day what is it? The shadow of a shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that, the more readily claims of this sort are transferred from
      hand to hand, the more extensive will be the Injury produced by a single
      failure. The laws of all nations sanction, in certain cases, the transfer
      of rights not yet reduced into possession. Mr. Southey would scarcely
      wish, we should think, that all indorsements of bills and notes should be
      declared invalid. Yet even if this were done, the transfer of claims would
      imperceptibly take place, to a very great extent. When the baker trusts
      the butcher, for example, he is in fact, though not in form, trusting the
      butcher&rsquo;s customers. A man who owes large bills to tradesmen, and
      fails to pay them, almost always produces distress through a very wide
      circle of people with whom he never dealt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, what Mr. Southey takes for a difference in kind is only a
      difference of form and degree. In every society men have claims on the
      property of others. In every society there is a possibility that some
      debtors may not be able to fulfil their obligations. In every society,
      therefore, there is wealth which is not tangible, and which may become the
      shadow of a shade. <span class="pagenum">153</span><a
      name="link153_rdquo_________id_" id="link153_rdquo_________id_"></a>Mr.
      Southey then proceeds to a dissertation on the national debt, which he
      considers in a new and most consolatory light, as a clear addition to the
      income of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can understand,&rdquo; says Sir Thomas, &ldquo;that it
      constitutes a great part of the national wealth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So large a part,&rdquo; answers Montesinos, &ldquo;that the
      interest amounted, during the prosperous time of agriculture, to as much
      as the rental of all the land in Great Britain; and at present to the
      rental of all lands, all houses, and all other fixed property put
      together.&rdquo; The Ghost and the Laureate agree that it is very
      desirable that there should be so secure and advantageous a deposit for
      wealth as the funds afford. Sir Thomas then proceeds:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another and far more momentous benefit must not be overlooked; the
      expenditure of an annual interest, equalling, as you have stated, the
      present rental of all fixed property.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That expenditure,&rdquo; quoth Montesinos, &ldquo;gives employment
      to half the industry in the kingdom, and feeds half the mouths. Take,
      indeed, the weight of the national debt from this great and complicated
      social machine, and the wheels must stop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From this passage we should have been inclined to think that Mr. Southey
      supposes the dividends to be a free gift periodically sent down from
      heaven to the fundholders, as quails and manna were sent to the
      Israelites; were it not that he has vouchsafed, in the following question
      and answer, to give the public some information which, we believe, was
      very little needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whence comes the interest?&rdquo; says Sir Thomas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is raised,&rdquo; answers Montesinos, &ldquo;by taxation.&rdquo;
      Now, has Mr. Southey ever considered what would <span class="pagenum">154</span><a
      name="link154" id="link154"></a>be done with this sum if it were not paid
      as interest to the national creditor? If he would think over this matter
      for a short time, we suspect that the &ldquo;momentous benefit&rdquo; of
      which he talks would appear to him to shrink strangely in amount. A
      fundholder, we will suppose, spends dividends amounting to five hundred
      pounds a year; and his ten nearest neighbours pay fifty pounds each to the
      tax-gatherer, for the purpose of discharging the interest of the national
      debt. If the debt were wiped out, a measure, be it understood, which we by
      no means recommend, the fundholder would cease to spend his five hundred
      pounds a year. He would no longer give employment to industry, or put food
      into the mouths of labourers. This Mr. Southey thinks a fearful evil. But
      is there no mitigating circumstances? Each of the ten neighbours of our
      fundholder has fifty pounds a year more than formerly. Each of them will,
      as it seems to our feeble understandings, employ more industry and feed
      more mouths than formerly. The sum is exactly the same. It is in
      different, hands. But on what grounds does Mr. Southey call upon us to
      believe that it is in the hands of men who will spend it less liberally or
      less judiciously? He seems to think that nobody but a fundholder can
      employ the poor; that, if a tax is remitted, those who formerly used to
      pay it proceed immediately to dig holes in the earth, and to bury the sum
      which the government had been accustomed to take; that no money can set
      industry in motion till such money has been taken by the tax-gatherer out
      of one man&rsquo;s pocket and put into another man&rsquo;s pocket. We
      really wish that Mr. Southey would try to prove this principle, which is
      indeed the foundation of his whole theory of finance: for we think it
      right to hint <span class="pagenum">155</span><a name="link155"
      id="link155"></a>to him that our hard-hearted and unimaginative generation
      will expect some more satisfactory reason than the only one with which he
      has yet favoured it, namely, a similitude touching evaporation and dew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the theory and the illustration, indeed, are old friends of ours. In
      every season of distress which we can remember, Mr. Southey has been
      proclaiming that it is not from economy, but from increased taxation, that
      the country must expect relief; and he still, we find, places the
      undoubting faith of a political Diafoirus, in his <br /><br /><span
      class="indent20">"I√Æesaignare, repurgare, et reclysterizare.&rdquo;
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A people,&rdquo; he tells us, &ldquo;may be too rich, but a
      government cannot be so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A state,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;cannot have more wealth at its
      command than may be employed for the general good, a liberal expenditure
      in national works being one of the surest means of promoting national
      prosperity; and the benefit being still more obvious, of an expenditure
      directed to the purposes of national improvement. But a people may be too
      rich.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We fully admit that a state cannot have at its command more wealth than
      may be employed for the general good. But neither can individuals, or
      bodies of individuals, have at their command more wealth than may be
      employed for the general good. If there be no limit to the sum which may
      be usefully laid out in public works and national improvement, then
      wealth, whether in the hands of private men or of the government, may
      always, if the possessors choose to spend it usefully, be usefully spent.
      The only ground, therefore, on which Mr. Southey can possibly maintain
      that a government cannot be too rich, but that a people may be too rich,
      must be this, that governments are more <span class="pagenum">156</span><a
      name="link156" id="link156"></a>likely to spend their money on good
      objects than private individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what is useful expenditure? &ldquo;A liberal expenditure in national
      works,&rdquo; says Mr. Southey, &ldquo;is one of the surest means for
      promoting national prosperity.&rdquo; What does he mean by national
      prosperity? Does he mean the wealth of the state? If so, his reasoning
      runs thus: The more wealth a state has the better; for the more wealth a
      state has the more wealth it will have. This is surely something like that
      fallacy, which is ungallantly termed a lady&rsquo;s reason. If by national
      prosperity he means the wealth of the people, of how gross a contradiction
      is Mr. Southey guilty. A people, he tells us, may be too rich: a
      government cannot: for a government can employ its riches in making the
      people richer. The wealth of the people is to be taken from them, because
      they have too much, and laid out in works, which will yield them more.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are really at a loss to determine whether Mr. Southey&rsquo;s reason
      for recommending large taxation is that it will make the people rich, or
      that it will make them poor. But we are sure that, if his object is to
      make them rich, he takes the wrong course. There are two or three
      principles respecting public works, which, as an experience of vast extent
      proves, may be trusted in almost every case.
    </p>
    <p>
      It scarcely ever happens that any private man or body of men will invest
      property in a canal, a tunnel, or a bridge, but from an expectation that
      the outlay will be profitable to them. No work of this sort can be
      profitable to private speculators, unless the public be willing to pay for
      the use of it. The public will not pay of their own accord for what yields
      no profit or convenience to them. There is thus a direct and <span
      class="pagenum">157</span><a name="link157" id="link157"></a>Previous
      connection between the motive which induces individuals to undertake such
      a work, and the utility of the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can we find any such connection in the case of a public work executed by a
      government? If it is useful, are the individuals who rule the country
      richer? If it is useless, are they poorer? A public man may be solicitous
      for his credit. But is not he likely to gain more credit by an useless
      display of ostentatious architecture in a great town than by the best road
      or the best canal in some remote province? The fame of public works is a
      much less certain test of their utility than the amount of toll collected
      at them. In a corrupt age, there will be direct embezzlement. In the
      purest age, there will be abundance of jobbing. Never were the statesmen
      of any country more sensitive to public opinion, and more spotless in
      pecuniary transactions, than those who have of late governed England. Yet
      we have only to look at the buildings recently erected in London for a
      proof of our rule. In a bad age, the fate of the public is to be robbed
      outright. In a good age, it is merely to have the dearest and the worst of
      every thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buildings for state purposes the state must erect. And here we think that,
      in general, the state ought to stop. We firmly believe that five hundred
      thousand pounds subscribed by individuals for rail-roads or canals would
      produce more advantage to the public than five millions voted by
      Parliament for the same purpose. There are certain old saws about the
      master&rsquo;s eye and about every body&rsquo;s business, in which we
      place very great faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, we have said, no consistency in Mr. Southey&rsquo;s political
      system. But if there be in his political <span class="pagenum">158</span><a
      name="link158" id="link158"></a>system any leading principle, any one
      error which diverges more widely and variously than any other, it is that
      of which his theory about national works is a ramification. He conceives
      that the business of the magistrate is, not merely to see that the persons
      and property of the people are secure from attack, but that he ought to be
      a jack-of-all-trades, architect, engineer, schoolmaster, merchant,
      theologian, a Lady Bountiful in every parish, a Paul Pry in every house,
      spying, eaves-dropping, relieving, admonishing, spending our money for us,
      and choosing our opinions for us. His principle is, if we understand it
      rightly, that no man can do any thing so well for himself as his rulers,
      be they who they may, can do it for him, and that a government approaches
      nearer and nearer to perfection, in proportion as it interferes more and
      more with the habits and notions of individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seems to be fully convinced that it is in the power of government to
      relieve all the distresses under which the lower orders labour. Nay, he
      considers doubt on this subject as impious. We cannot refrain from quoting
      his argument on this subject. It is a perfect jewel of logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Many thousands in your metropolis,&rsquo; says Sir Thomas
      More, &lsquo;rise every morning without knowing how they are to subsist
      during the day; as many of them, where they are to lay their heads at
      night. All men, even the vicious themselves, know that wickedness leads to
      misery: but many, even among the good and the wise, have yet to learn that
      misery is almost as often the cause of wickedness.&rsquo; </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There are many,&rsquo; says Montesinos, &lsquo;who know
      this, but believe that it is not in the power of human institutions to
      prevent this misery. They see the effect, but regard the causes as
      inseparable from the condition of human nature.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;As surely as God is good,&rsquo; replies Sir Thomas, &lsquo;so
      surely there is no such thing as necessary evil. For, by the religious
      <span class="pagenum">159</span><a name="link159" id="link159"></a>mind,
      sickness, and pain I and death, are not to be accounted evils.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now if sickness, pain, and death, are not evils, we cannot understand why
      it should be an evil that thousands should rise without knowing how they
      are to subsist. The only evil of hunger is that it produces first pain,
      then sickness, and finally death. If it did not produce these, it would be
      no calamity. If these are not evils, it is no calamity. We will propose a
      very plain dilemma: either physical pain is an evil, or it is not an evil.
      If it is an evil, then there is necessary evil in the universe: if it is
      not, why should the poor be delivered from it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Southey entertains as exaggerated a notion of the wisdom of
      governments as of their power. He speaks with the greatest disgust of the
      respect now paid to public opinion. That opinion is, according to him, to
      be distrusted and dreaded; its usurpation ought to be vigorously resisted;
      and the practice of yielding to it is likely to ruin the country. To
      maintain police is, according to him, only one of the ends of government.
      The duties of a ruler are patriarchal and paternal. He ought to consider
      the moral discipline of the people as his first object, to establish a
      religion, to train the whole community in that religion, and to consider
      all dissenters as his own enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Nothing,&rsquo; says Sir Thomas, &lsquo;is more certain,
      than that religion is the basis upon which civil government rests; that
      from religion power derives its authority, laws their efficacy, and both
      their zeal and sanction; and it is necessary that this religion be
      established as for the security of the state, and for the welfare of the
      people, who would otherwise be moved to and fro with every wind of
      doctrine. A state is secure in proportion as the people are attached to
      its institutions: it is, therefore, the first and plainest rule of sound
      policy, that the people be trained up in the way <span class="pagenum">160</span><a
      name="link160" id="link160"></a>they should go. The state that neglects
      this prepares its own destruction; and they who train them in any other
      way are undermining it. Nothing in abstract science can be more certain
      than these positions are.&rsquo; </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;1 All of which,&rsquo; answers Montesinos, &lsquo;are nevertheless
      denied by our professors of the arts Babblative and Scribblative: some in
      the audacity of evil designs, and others in the glorious assurance of
      impenetrable ignorance.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The greater part of the two volumes before us is merely an amplification
      of these paragraphs. What does Mr. Southey mean by saying that religion is
      demonstrably the basis of civil government? He cannot surely mean that men
      have no motives except those derived from religion for establishing and
      supporting-civil government, that no temporal advantage is derived from
      civil government, that men would experience no temporal inconvenience from
      living in a state of anarchy? If he allows, as we think he must allow,
      that it is for the good of mankind in this world to have civil government,
      and that the great majority of mankind have always thought it for their
      good In this world to have civil government, we then have a basis for
      government quite distinct from religion. It is true that the Christian
      religion sanctions government, as it sanctions every thing which promotes
      the happiness and virtue of our species. But we are at a loss to conceive
      in what sense religion can be said to be the basis of government, in which
      religion is not also the basis of the practices of eating, drinking, and
      lighting fires in cold weather. Nothing in history is more certain than
      that government has existed, has received some obedience, and has given
      some protection, in times in which it derived no support from religion, in
      times in which there was no religion that influenced the hearts and lives
      of men. It was not from dread of Tartarus, or <span class="pagenum">161</span><a
      name="link161" id="link161"></a>from belief in the Elysian fields, that an
      Athenian wished to have some institutions which might keep Orestes from
      filching his cloak, or Aliclias from breaking his head. &ldquo;It is from
      religion,&rdquo; says Mr. Southey, &ldquo;that power derives its
      authority, and laws their efficacy.&rdquo; From what religion does our
      power over the Hindoos derive its authority, or the law in virtue of which
      we hang Brahmins its efficacy? For thousands of years civil government has
      existed in almost every corner of the world, in ages of priestcraft, in
      ages of fanaticism, in ages of Epicurean indifference, in ages of
      enlightened piety. However pure or impure the faith of the people might
      be, whether they adored a beneficent or a malignant power, whether they
      thought the soul mortal or immortal, they have, as soon as they ceased to
      be absolute savages, found out their need of civil government, and
      instituted it accordingly. It is as universal as the practice of cookery.
      Yet, it is as certain, says Mr. Southey, as any thing in abstract science,
      that government is founded on religion. We should like to know what notion
      Mr. Southey has of the demonstrations of abstract science. A very vague
      one, we suspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proof proceeds. As religion is the basis of government, and as the
      state is secure in proportion as the people are attached to public
      institutions, it is therefore, says Mr. Southey, the first rule of policy,
      that the government should train the people in the way in which they
      should go; and it is plain that those who train them in any other way are
      undermining the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it does not appear to us to be the first object that people should
      always believe in the established religion and be attached to the
      established government. A religion may be false. A government may be
      oppressive. And whatever support government gives to <span class="pagenum">162</span><a
      name="link162" id="link162"></a>false religions, or religion to oppressive
      governments, Ive consider as a clear evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maxim, that governments ought to train the people in the way in which
      they should go, sounds well. But is there any reason for believing that a
      government is more likely to lead the people in the right way than the
      people to fall into the right way of themselves? Have there not been
      governments which were blind leaders of the blind? Are there not still
      such governments? Can it be laid down as a general rule that the movement
      of political and religious truth is rather downwards from the government
      to the people than upwards from the people to the government? These are
      questions which it is of importance to have clearly resolved. Mr. Southey
      declaims against public opinion, which is now, he tells us, usurping
      supreme power. Formerly, according to him, the laws governed; now public
      opinion governs. What are laws but expressions of the opinion of some
      class which has power over the rest of the community? By what was the
      world ever governed but by the opinion of some person or persons? By what
      else can it ever be governed? What are all systems, religious, political,
      or scientific, but opinions resting on evidence more or less satisfactory?
      The question is not between human opinion and some higher and more certain
      mode of arriving at truth, but between opinion and opinion, between the
      opinions of one man and another, or of one class and another, or of one
      generation and another. Public opinion is not infallible; but can Mr.
      Southey construct any institutions which shall secure to us the guidance
      of an infallible opinion? Can Mr. Southey select any family, any
      profession, any class, in short, distinguished by any plain badge from the
      rest of the <span class="pagenum">163</span><a name="link163" id="link163"></a>community,
      whose opinion is more likely to be just than this much abused public
      opinion? Would he choose the peers, for example? Or the two hundred
      tallest men in the country? Or the poor Knights of Windsor? Or children
      who are born with cauls? Or the seventh sons of seventh sons? We cannot
      suppose that he would recommend popular election; for that is merely an
      appeal to public opinion. And to say that society ought to be governed by
      the opinion of the wisest and best, though true, is useless. Whose opinion
      is to decide, who are the wisest and best?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Southey and many other respectable people seem to think that, when
      they have once proved the moral and religious training of the people to be
      a most important object, it follows, of course, that it is an object which
      the government ought to pursue. They forget that we have to consider, not
      merely the goodness of the end, but also the fitness of the means. Neither
      in the natural nor in the political body have all members the same office.
      There is surely no contradiction in saying that a certain section of the
      community may be quite competent to protect the persons and property of
      the rest, yet quite unfit to direct our opinions, or to superintend our
      private habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      So strong is the interest of a ruler to protect his subjects against all
      depredations and outrages except his own, so clear and simple are the
      means by which this end is to be effected, that men are probably better
      off under the worst governments in the world than they would be in a state
      of anarchy. Even when the appointment of magistrates has been left to
      chance, as in the Italian Republics, things have gone on far better than
      if there had been no magistrates at all, and if every man had done what
      seemed right in his own <span class="pagenum">164</span><a
      name="link164_rdquo_________id_" id="link164_rdquo_________id_"></a>eyes.
      But we see no reason for thinking that the opinions of the magistrate on
      speculative question are more likely to be right than those of any other
      man. None of the modes by which a magistrate is appointed, popular
      election, the accident of the lot, or the accident of birth, affords, as
      far as we can perceive, much security for his being wiser than any of his
      neighbours. The chance of his being wiser than all his neighbours together
      is still smaller. Now we cannot understand how it can be laid down that it
      is the duty and the right of one class to direct the opinions of another,
      unless it can be proved that the former class is more likely to form just
      opinions than the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duties of government would be, as Mr. Southey says that they are,
      paternal, if a government were necessarily as much superior in wisdom to a
      people as the most foolish father, for a time, is to the most intelligent
      child, and if a government loved a people as fathers generally love their
      children. But there is no reason to believe that a government will have
      either the paternal warmth of affection or the paternal superiority of
      intellect. Mr. Southey might as well say that the duties of the shoemaker
      are paternal and that it is an usurpation in any man not of the craft to
      say that his shoes are bad and to insist on having better. The division of
      labour would be no blessing, if those by whom a thing is done were to pay
      no attention to the opinion of those for whom it is done. The shoemaker,
      in the Relapse, tells Lord Foppington that his lordship is mistaken in
      supposing that his shoe pinches. &ldquo;It does not pinch; it cannot
      pinch; I know my business; and I never made a better shoe.&rdquo; This is
      the way in which Mr. Southey would have a government treat a people who
      usurp the privilege of thinking. Nay, the <span class="pagenum">165</span><a
      name="link165" id="link165"></a>shoemaker of Vanbrugh has the advantage in
      the comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      He contented himself with regulating his customer&rsquo;s shoes, about
      which he had peculiar means of information, and did not presume to dictate
      about the coat and hat. But Mr. Southey would have the rulers of a country
      prescribe opinions to the people, not only about politics, but about
      matters concerning which a government has no peculiar sources of
      information, and concerning which any man in the streets may know as much
      and think as justly as the King, namely religion and morals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men are never so likely to settle a question rightly as when they discuss
      it freely, A government can interfere in discussion only by making it less
      free than it would otherwise be. Men are most likely to form just opinions
      when they have no other wish than to know the truth, and are exempt from
      all influence, either of hope or fear. Government, as government, can
      bring nothing but the influence of hopes and fears to support its
      doctrines. It carries on controversy, not with reasons, but with threats
      and bribes. If it employs reasons, it does so, not in virtue of any powers
      which belong to it as a government. Thus, instead of a contest between
      argument and argument, we have a contest between argument and force.
      Instead of a contest in which truth, from the natural constitution of the
      human mind, has a decided advantage over falsehood, we have a contest in
      which truth can be victorious only by accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what, after all, is the security which this training gives to
      governments? Mr. Southey would scarcely propose that discussion should be
      more effectually shackled, that public opinion should be more, strictly
      disciplined into conformity with established <span class="pagenum">166</span><a
      name="link166" id="link166"></a>institutions, than in Spain and Italy. Yet
      we know that the restraints which exist in Spain and Italy have not
      prevented atheism from spreading among the educated classes, and
      especially among those whose office it is to minister at the altars of
      God. All our readers know how, at the time of the French Revolution,
      priest after priest came forward to declare that his doctrine, his
      ministry, his whole life, had been a lie, a mummery during which he could
      scarcely compose his countenance sufficiently to carry on the imposture.
      This was the case of a false, or at least of a grossly corrupted religion.
      Let us take then the case of all others most favourable to Mr. Southey&rsquo;s
      argument. Let us take that form of religion which he holds to be the
      purest, the system of the Arminian part of the Church of England. Let us
      take the form of government which he most admires and regrets, the
      government of England in the time of Charles the First. Would he wish to
      see a closer connection between church and state than then existed? Would
      he wish for more powerful ecclesiastical tribunals? for a more zealous
      king? for a more active primate? Would he wish to see a more complete
      monopoly of public instruction given to the Established Church? Could any
      government do more to train the people in the way in which he would have
      them? And in what did all this training end? The Report of the state of
      the Province of Canterbury, delivered by Laud to his master at the close
      of 1639, represents the Church of England as in the highest and most palmy
      state. So effectually had the government pursued that policy which Mr.
      Southey wishes to see revived that there was scarcely the least appearance
      of dissent. Most of the bishops stated that all was well amoung their
      flocks. Seven or eight <span class="pagenum">167</span><a
      name="link167_rdquo_________id_" id="link167_rdquo_________id_"></a>persons
      in the diocese of Peterborough had seemed refractory to the church, but
      had made ample submission. In Norfolk and Suffolk all whom there had been
      reason to suspect had made profession of conformity, and appeared to
      observe it strictly. It is confessed that there was a little difficulty in
      bringing some of the vulgar in Suffolk to take the sacrament at the rails
      in the chancel. This was the only open instance of non-conformity which
      the vigilant eye of Laud could detect in all the dioceses of his
      twenty-one suffragans, on the very eve of a revolution in which primate,
      and church, and monarch, and monarchy were to perish together. .
    </p>
    <p>
      At which time would Mr. Southey pronounce the constitution more secure; in
      1639, when Laud presented this Report to Charles; or now, when thousands
      of meetings openly collect millions of dissenters, when designs against
      the tithes are openly avowed, when books attacking not only the
      Establishment, but the first principles of Christianity, are openly sold
      in the streets? The signs of discontent, he tells us, are stronger in
      England now than in France when the States-General met: and hence he would
      have us infer that a revolution like that of France may be at hand. Does
      he not know that the danger of states is to be estimated, not by what
      breaks out of the public mind, but by what stays in it? Can he conceive
      any thing more terrible than the situation of a government which rules
      without apprehension over a people of hypocrites, which is flattered by
      the press and cursed in the inner chambers, which exults in the attachment
      and obedience of its subjects, and knows not that those subjects are
      leagued against it in a free-masonry of hatred, the sign of which is every
      day conveyed in <span class="pagenum">168</span><a
      name="link168_rdquo_________id_" id="link168_rdquo_________id_"></a>the
      glance of ten thousand eyes, the pressure of ten thousand hands, and the
      tone of ten thousand voices? Profound and ingenious policy! Instead of
      curing the disease, to remove those symptoms by which alone its nature can
      be known! To leave the serpent his deadly sting, and deprive him only of
      his warning rattle!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the people whom Charles had so assiduously trained in the good way
      had rewarded his paternal care by cutting off his head, a new kind of
      training came into fashion. Another government arose which, like the
      former, considered religion as its surest basis, and the religious
      discipline of the people as its first duty. Sanguinary laws were enacted
      against libertinism; profane pictures were burned: drapery was put on
      indecorous statues; the theatres were shut up; fast-days were numerous;
      and the Parliament resolved that no person should be admitted into any
      public employment, unless the House should be first satisfied of his vital
      godliness. We know what was the end of this training. We know that it
      ended in impiety, in filthy and heartless sensuality, in the dissolution
      of all ties of honour and morality. We know that at this very day
      scriptural phrases, scriptural names, perhaps some scriptural doctrines,
      excite disgust and ridicule, solely because they are associated with the
      austerity of that period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus has the experiment of training the people in established forms of
      religion been twice tried in England on a large scale, once by Charles and
      Laud, and once by the Puritans. The High Tories of our time still
      entertain many of the feelings and opinions of Charles and Laud, though in
      a mitigated form; nor is it difficult to see that the heirs of the
      Puritans are still amongst us. It would be desirable that each of <span
      class="pagenum">169</span><a name="link169" id="link169"></a>these parties
      should remember how little advantage or honour it formerly derived from
      the closest alliance with power, that it fell by the support of rulers,
      and rose by their opposition, that of the two systems that in which the
      people were at any time drilled was always at that time the unpopular
      system, that the training of the High Church ended in the reign of the
      Puritans, and that the training of the Puritans ended in the reign of the
      harlots.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was quite natural. Nothing is so galling to a people not broken in
      from the birth as a paternal, or, in other words, a meddling government, a
      government which tells them what to read, and say, and eat, and drink, and
      wear. Our fathers could not bear it two hundred years ago; and we are not
      more patient than they. Mr. Southey thinks that the yoke of the church is
      dropping off because it is loose. We feel convinced that it is borne only
      because it is easy, and that, in the instant in which an attempt is made
      to tighten it, it will be flung away. It will be neither the first nor the
      strongest yoke that has been broken asunder and trampled under foot in the
      day of the vengeance of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      How far Mr. Southey would have the government carry its measures for
      training the people in the doctrines of the church, we are unable to
      discover. In one passage Sir Thomas More asks with great vehemence,
      &ldquo;Is it possible that your laws should suffer the unbelievers to
      exist as a party? Vetitum est adeo sceleris nihil?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Montesinos answers. &ldquo;They avow themselves in defiance of the laws.
      The fashionable doctrine which the press at this time maintains is, that
      this is a matter in which the laws ought not to interfere, every man <span
      class="pagenum">170</span><a name="link170" id="link170"></a>having a
      right, both to form what opinion he pleases upon religious subjects, and
      to promulgate that opinion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear, therefore, that Mr. Southey would not give full and perfect
      toleration to infidelity. In another passage, however, he observes with
      some truth, though too sweepingly, that &ldquo;any degree of intolerance
      short of that full extent which the Papal Church exercises where it has
      the power, acts upon the opinions which it is intended to suppress, like
      pruning upon vigorous plants; they grow the stronger for it.&rdquo; These
      two passages, put together, would lead us to the conclusion that, in Mr.
      Southey&rsquo;s opinion, the utmost severity ever employed by the Roman
      Catholic Church in the days of its greatest power ought to be employed
      against unbelievers in England; in plain words, that Carlile and his
      shopmen ought to be burned in Smith-field, and that every person who, when
      called upon, should decline to make a solemn profession of Christianity
      ought to suffer the same fate. We do not, however, believe that Mr.
      Southey would recommend such a course, though his language would,
      according to all the rules of logic, justify us in supposing this to be
      his meaning. His opinions form no system at all. He never sees, at one
      glance, more of a question than will furnish matter for one flowing and
      well turned sentence; so that it would be the height of unfairness to
      charge him personally with holding a doctrine, merely because that
      doctrine is deducible, though by the closest and most accurate reasoning,
      from the premises which he has laid down. We are, therefore, left
      completely in the dark as to Mr. Southey&rsquo;s opinions about
      toleration. Immediately after censuring the government for not punishing
      infidels, he proceeds to discuss <span class="pagenum">171</span><a
      name="link171" id="link171"></a>the question of the Catholic disabilities,
      now, thank God, removed, and defends them on the ground that the Catholic
      doctrines tend to persecution, and that the Catholics persecuted when they
      had power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must persecute,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;if they believe their
      own creed, for conscience-sake; and if they do not believe it, they must
      persecute for policy; because it is only by intolerance that so corrupt
      and injurious a system can be upheld.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That unbelievers should not be persecuted is an instance of national
      depravity at which the glorified spirits stand aghast. Yet a sect of
      Christians is to be excluded from power, because those who formerly held
      the same opinions were guilty of persecution. We have said that we do not
      very well know what Mr. Southey&rsquo;s opinion about toleration is. But,
      on the whole, we take it to be this, that everybody is to tolerate him,
      and that he is to tolerate nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will not be deterred by any fear of misrepresentation from expressing
      our hearty approbation of the mild, wise, and eminently Christian manner
      in which the Church and the Government have lately acted with respect to
      blasphemous publications. We praise them for not having thought it
      necessary to encircle a religion pure, merciful, and philosophical, a
      religion to the evidence of which the highest intellects have yielded,
      with the defences of a false and bloody superstition. The ark of God was
      never taken till it was surrounded by the arms of earthly defenders. In
      captivity, its sanctity was sufficient to vindicate it from insult, and to
      lay the hostile fiend prostrate on the threshold of his own temple. The
      real security of Christianity is to be found in its benevolent morality,
      in its exquisite adaptation to the human heart, in the <span
      class="pagenum">172</span><a name="link172" id="link172"></a>facility with
      which its scheme accommodates itself to the capacity of every human
      intellect, in the consolation which it bears to the house of mourning, in
      the light with which it brightens the great mystery of the grave. To such
      a system it can bring no addition of dignity or of strength, that it is
      part and parcel of the common law. It is not now for the first time left
      to rely on the force of its own evidences and the attractions of its own
      beauty. Its sublime theology confounded the Grecian schools in the fair
      conflict of reason with reason. The bravest and wisest of the C√¶sars found
      their arms and their policy unavailing, when opposed to the weapons that
      were not carnal and the kingdom that was not of this world. The victory
      which Porphyry and Diocletian failed to gain is not, to all appearance,
      reserved for any of those who have, in this age, directed their attacks
      against the last restraint of the powerful and the last hope of the
      wretched. The whole history of Christianity shows, that she is in far
      greater danger of being corrupted by the alliance of power, than of being
      crushed by its opposition. Those who thrust temporal sovereignty upon her
      treat her as their prototypes treated her author. They bow the knee, and
      spit upon her; they cry &ldquo;Hail!&rdquo; and smite her on the cheek;
      they put a sceptre in her hand, but it is a fragile reed; they crown her,
      but it is with thorns; they cover with purple the wounds which their own
      hands have inflicted on her; and inscribe magnificent titles over the
      cross on which they have fixed her to perish in ignominy and pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general view which Mr. Southey takes of the prospects of society is
      very gloomy; but we comfort ourselves with the consideration that Mr.
      Southey is no prophet. He foretold, we remember, on the very <span
      class="pagenum">173</span><a name="link173" id="link173"></a>eve of the
      abolition of the Test and Corporation Acts, that these hateful laws were
      immortal, and that pious minds would long be gratified by seeing the most
      solemn religious rite of the Church profaned for the purpose of upholding
      her political supremacy. In the book before us, he says that Catholics
      cannot possibly be admitted into Parliament until those whom Johnson
      called &ldquo;the bottomless Whigs&rdquo; come into power. While the book
      was in the press, the prophecy was falsified: and a Tory of the Tories,
      Mr. Southey&rsquo;s own favourite hero, won and wore that noblest wreath,
      &ldquo;Ob cives servatos.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The signs of the times, Mr. Southey tells us, are very threatening. His
      fears for the country would decidedly preponderate over his hopes, but for
      his firm reliance on the mercy of God. Now, as we know that God has once
      suffered the civilised world to be overrun by savages, and the Christian
      religion to be corrupted by doctrines which made it, for some ages, almost
      as bad as Paganism, we cannot think it inconsistent with his attributes
      that similar calamities should again befal mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      We look, however, on the state of the world, and of this kingdom in
      particular, with much greater satisfaction and with better hopes. Mr.
      Southey speaks with contempt of those who think the savage state happier
      than the social. On this subject, he says, Rousseau never imposed on him
      even in his youth. But he conceives that a community which has advanced a
      little way in civilisation is happier than one which has made greater
      progress. The Britons in the time of C√¶sar were happier, he suspects, than
      the English of the nineteenth century. On the whole, he selects the
      generation which preceded the Reformation <span class="pagenum">174</span><a
      name="link174" id="link174"></a>as that in which the people of this
      country were better off than at any time before or since.
    </p>
    <p>
      This opinion rests on nothing, as far as we can see, except his own
      individual associations. He is a man of letters; and a life destitute of
      literary pleasures seems insipid to him. He abhors the spirit of the
      present generation, the severity of its studies, the boldness of its
      inquiries, and the disdain with which it regards some old prejudices by
      which his own mind is held in bondage. He dislikes an utterly
      unenlightened age: he dislikes an investigation; and reforming age. The
      first twenty years of the sixteenth century would have exactly suited him.
      They furnished just the quantity of intellectual excitement which he
      requires. The learned few read and wrote largely. A scholar was held in
      high estimation. But the rabble did not presume to think; and even the
      most inquiring and independent of the educated classes paid more reverence
      to authority, and less to reason, than is usual in our time. This is a
      state of things in which Mr. Southey would have found himself quite
      comfortable; and, accordingly, he pronounces it the happiest state of
      things ever known in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The savages were wretched, lays Mr. Southey: but the people in the time of
      Sir Thomas More were happier than either they or we. Now we think it quite
      certain that we have the advantage over the contemporaries of Sir Thomas
      More, in every point in which they had any advantage over savages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Southey does not even pretend to maintain that the people in the
      sixteenth century were better lodged or clothed than at present. He seems
      to admit that in these respects there has been some little improvement, it
      is indeed a matter about which scarcely any doubt <span class="pagenum">175</span><a
      name="link175" id="link175"></a>can exist in the most perverse mind that
      the improvements of machinery have lowered the price of manufactured
      articles, and have brought within the reach of the poorest some
      conveniences which Sir Thomas More or his master could not have obtained
      at any price.
    </p>
    <p>
      The labouring classes, however, were, according to Mr. Southey, better fed
      three hundred years ago than at present. We believe that he is completely
      in error on this point. The condition of servants in noble and wealthy
      families, and of scholars at the Universities must surely have been better
      in those times than that of day-labourers; and we are sure that it was not
      better than that of our workhouse paupers. From the household book of the
      Northumberland family, we find that in one of the greatest establishments
      of the kingdom the servants lived very much as common sailors live now. In
      the reign of Edward the Sixth the state of the students at Cambridge is
      described to us, on the very best authority, as most wretched. Many of
      them dined on pottage made of a farthing&rsquo;s worth of beef with a
      little salt and oatmeal, and literally nothing else. This account we have
      from a contemporary master of St. John&rsquo;s. Our parish poor now eat
      wheat bread. In the sixteenth century the labourer was glad to get barley,
      and was often forced to content himself with poorer fare. In Harrison&rsquo;s
      introduction to Holinshed we have an account of the state of our working
      population in the &ldquo;golden days,&rdquo; as Mr. Southey calls them,
      &ldquo;of good Queen Bess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentilitie,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;commonly provide themselves
      sufficiently of wheat for their own tables, why lest their household and
      poore neighbours in some shires are inforced to content themselves with
      rye or barleie; yea, and in time of <span class="pagenum">176</span><a
      name="link176_rdquo_________id_" id="link176_rdquo_________id_"></a>dearth,
      many with bread made eyther of beanes, peason, or otes, or of altogether,
      and some acornes among. I will not say that this extremity is oft so well
      to be seen in time of plentie as of dearth; but if I should I could easily
      bring my trial: for albeit there be much more grounde eared nowe almost in
      everye place then liathe beene of late yeares, yet such a price of corne
      continueth in cache towne and markete, without any just cause, that the
      artificer and poore labouring man is not able to reach unto it, but is
      driven to content himself with horse-corne.&rdquo; We should like to see
      what the effect would be of putting any parish in England now on allowance
      of &ldquo;horse-corne.&rdquo; The helotry of Mammon are not, in our day,
      so easily enforced to content themselves as the peasantry of that happy
      period, as Mr. Southey considers it, which elapsed between the fall of the
      feudal and the rise of the commercial tyranny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people,&rdquo; says Mr. Southey, &ldquo;are worse fed than when
      they were fishers.&rdquo; And yet in another place he complains that they
      will not eat fish. &ldquo;They have contracted,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I
      know not how, some obstinate prejudice against a kind of food at once
      wholesome and delicate, and every where to be obtained cheaply and in
      abundance, were the demand for it as general as it ought to be.&rdquo; It
      is true that the lower orders have an obstinate prejudice against fish.
      But hunger has no such obstinate prejudices. If what was formerly a common
      diet I now eaten only in times of severe pressure, the inference is plain.
      The people must be fed with what they at least think better food than that
      of their ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advice and medicine which the poorest labourer <span class="pagenum">177</span><a
      name="link177" id="link177"></a>can now obtain, in disease, or after an
      accident, is far superior to what Henry the Eighth could have commanded.
      Scarcely any part of the country is out of the reach of practitioners who
      are probably not so far inferior to Sir Henry Halford as they are superior
      to Dr. Butts. That there has been a great improvement in this respect, Mr.
      Southey allows. Indeed he could not well have denied it. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
      says he, &ldquo;the evils for which these sciences are the palliative,
      have increased since the time of the Druids, in a proportion that heavily
      overweighs the benefit of improved therapeutics.&rdquo; We know nothing
      either of the diseases or the remedies of the Druids. But we are quite
      sure that the improvement of medicine has far more than kept pace with the
      increase of disease during the last three centuries. This is proved by the
      best possible evidence. The term of human life is decidedly longer in
      England than in any former age, respecting which we possess any
      information on which we can Lely. All the rants in the world about
      picturesque cottages and temples of Mammon will not shake this argument.
      No test of the physical well-being of society can be named so decisive as
      that which is furnished by bills of mortality. That the lives of the
      people of this country have been gradually lengthening during the course
      of several generations, is as certain as any fact in statistics; and that
      the lives of men should become longer and longer, while their bodily
      condition during life is becoming worse and worse, is utterly incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let our readers think over these circumstances. Let them take into the
      account the sweating sickness and the plague. Let them take into the
      account that fearful disease which first made its appearance in the <span
      class="pagenum">178</span><a name="link178" id="link178"></a>generation to
      which Mr. Southey assigns the palm of felicity, and raged through Europe
      with a fury at which the physician stood aghast, and before which the
      people were swept away by myriads. Let them consider the state of the
      northern counties, constantly the scene of robberies, rapes, massacres,
      and conflagrations. Let them add to all this the fact that seventy-two
      thousand persons suffered death by the hands of the executioner during the
      reign of Henry the Eighth, and judge between the nineteenth and the
      sixteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not say that the lower orders in England do not suffer severe
      hardships. But, in spite of Mr. Southey&rsquo;s assertions, and in spite
      of the assertions of a class of politicians, who, differing from Mr.
      Southey in every other point, agree with him in this, we are inclined to
      doubt whether the labouring classes here really suffer greater physical
      distress than the labouring classes of the most flourishing countries of
      the Continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will scarcely be maintained that the lazzaroni who sleep under the
      porticoes of Naples, or the beggars who besiege the convents of Spain, are
      in a happier situation than the English commonalty. The distress which has
      lately been experienced in the northern part of Germany, one of the best
      governed and most prosperous regions of Europe, surpasses, if we have been
      correctly informed, any thing which has of late years been known among us.
      In Norway and Sweden the peasantry are constantly compelled to mix bark
      with their bread; and even this expedient has not always preserved whole
      families and neighbourhoods from perishing together of famine. An
      experiment has lately been tried in the kingdom of the Netherlands, which
      <span class="pagenum">179</span><a name="link179" id="link179"></a>has
      been cited to prove the possibility of establishing agricultural colonies
      on the waste lands of England, but which proves to our minds nothing so
      clearly as this, that the rate of subsistence to which the labouring
      classes are reduced in the Netherlands is miserably low, and very far
      inferior to that of the English paupers. No distress which the people here
      have endured for centuries approaches to that which has been felt by the
      French in our own time. The beginning of the year 1817 was a time of great
      distress in this island. But the state of the lowest classes here was
      luxury compared with that of the people of France. We find in Magendie&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;Journal de Physiologie Exp√©rimentale&rdquo; a paper on a point of
      physiology connected with the distress of that season. It appears that the
      inhabitants of six departments, Aix, Jura, Doubs, Haute Saone, Vosges, and
      Saone-et-Loire, were reduced first to oatmeal and potatoes, and at last to
      nettles, bean-stalks, and other kinds of herbage fit only for cattle; that
      when the next harvest enabled them to eat barley-bread, many of them died
      from intemperate indulgence in what they thought an exquisite repast; and
      that a dropsy of a peculiar description was produced by the hard fare of
      the year. Dead bodies were found on the roads and in the fields. A single
      surgeon dissected six of these, and found the stomach shrunk, and filled
      with the unwholesome aliments which hunger had driven men to share with
      beasts. Such extremity of distress as this is never heard of in England,
      or even in Ireland. We are, on the whole, inclined to think, though we
      would speak with diffidence on a point on which it would be rash to
      pronounce a positive judgment without a much longer and closer
      investigation than we have bestowed upon it, that the labouring <span
      class="pagenum">180</span><a name="link180" id="link180"></a>classes of
      this island, though they have their grievances and distresses, some
      produced by their own improvidence, some by the errors of their rulers,
      are on the whole better off as to physical comforts than the inhabitants
      of any equally extensive district of the old world. For this very reason,
      suffering is more acutely felt and more loudly bewailed here than
      elsewhere. We must take into the account the liberty of discussion, and
      the strong interest which the opponents of a ministry always have to
      exaggerate the extent of the public disasters. There are countries in
      which the people quietly endure distress that here would shake the
      foundations of the state, countries in which the inhabitants of a whole
      province turn out to eat grass with less clamour than one Spitalfields
      weaver would make here, if the overseers were to put him on barley-bread.
      In those new commonwealths in which a civilised population has at its
      command a boundless extent of the richest soil, the condition of the
      labourer is probably happier than in any society which has lasted for many
      centuries. But in the old world we must confess ourselves unable to find
      any satisfactory record of any great nation, past or present, in which the
      working classes have been in a more comfortable situation than in England
      during the last thirty years. When this island was thinly peopled, it was
      barbarous: there was little capital; and that little was insecure. It is
      now the richest and the most highly civilised spot in the world; but the
      population is dense. Thus we have never known that golden age which the
      lower orders In the United States are now enjoying. We have never known an
      age of liberty, of order, and of education, an age in which the mechanical
      sciences were carried to a great height, yet in which the people were not
      sufficiently <span class="pagenum">181</span><a name="link181" id="link181"></a>numerous
      to cultivate even the most fertile valleys. But, &lsquo;when we compare
      our own condition with that of our ancestors, we think it clear that the
      advantages arising from the progress of civilisation have far more than
      counterbalanced the disadvantages arising from the progress of population.
      &ldquo;While our numbers have increased tenfold, our wealth has increased
      a hundred-fold. Though there are so many more people to share the wealth
      now existing in the country than there were in the sixteenth century, it
      seems certain that a greater share falls to almost every individual than
      fell to the share of any of the corresponding class in the sixteenth
      century. The King keeps a more splendid court. The establishments of the
      nobles are more magnificent. The esquires are richer; the merchants are
      richer; the shopkeepers are richer. The serving-man, the artisan, and the
      husbandman, have a more copious and palatable supply of food, better
      clothing, and better furniture. This is no reason for tolerating abuses,
      or for neglecting any means of ameliorating the condition of our poorer
      countrymen. But it is a reason against telling them, as some of our
      philosophers are constantly telling them, that they are the most wretched
      people who ever existed on the face of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have already adverted to Mr. Southey&rsquo;s amusing doctrine
      about national wealth. A state, says he, cannot be too rich; but a people
      may be too rich. His reason for thinking this is extremely curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>A people may be too rich, because it is the tendency of the
      commercial, and more especially of the manufacturing system, to collect
      wealth rather than to diffuse it. Where wealth is necessarily employed in
      any of the speculations of trade, its increase is in proportion to its
      amount. Great capitalists become like pikes in a fish-pond, who devour the
      weaker fish; and it is but too certain. <span class="pagenum">182</span><a
      name="link182" id="link182"></a>that the poverty of one part of the people
      seems to increase in the same ratio as the riches of another. There are
      examples of this in history. In Portugal, when the high tide of wealth
      flowed in from the conquests in Africa and the East, the effect of that
      great influx was not more visible in the augmented splendour of the court,
      and the luxury of the higher ranks, than in the distress of the people</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Southey&rsquo;s instance is not a very fortunate one. The wealth which
      did so little for the Portuguese was not the fruit either of manufactures
      or of commerce carried on by private individuals. It was the wealth, not
      of the people, but of the government and its creatures, of those who, as
      Mr. Southey thinks, can never be too rich. The fact is that Mr. Southey&rsquo;s
      proposition is opposed to all history, and to the ph√¶nomena which surround
      us on every side. England is the richest country in Europe, the most
      commercial country, and the country in which manufactures flourish most.
      Russia and Poland are the poorest countries in Europe. They have scarcely
      any trade, and none but the rudest manufactures. Is wealth more diffused
      in Russia and Poland than in England? There are individuals in Russia and
      Poland whose incomes are probably equal to those of our richest
      countrymen. It may be doubted whether there are not, in those countries,
      as many fortunes of eighty thousand a year as here. But are there as many
      fortunes of two thousand a year, or of one thousand a year? There are
      parishes in England which contain more people of between three hundred and
      three thousand pounds a year than could be found in all the dominions of
      the Emperor Nicholas. The neat and commodious houses which have been built
      in London and its vicinity, for people of this class, within the last
      thirty years would of themselves <span class="pagenum">183</span><a
      name="link183" id="link183"></a>form a city larger than the capitals of
      some European kingdoms. And this is the state of society in which the
      great proprietors have devoured a smaller!
    </p>
    <p>
      The cure which Mr. Southey thinks that he has discovered is worthy of the
      sagacity which he has shown in detecting the evil. The calamities arising
      from the collection of wealth in the hands of a few capitalists are to be
      remedied by collecting it in the hands of one great capitalist, who has no
      conceivable motive to use it better than other capitalists, the
      all-devouring state.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not strange that, differing so widely from Mr. Southey as to the
      past progress of society, we should differ from him also as to its
      probable destiny. He thinks, that to all outward appearance, the country
      is hastening to destruction; but he relies firmly on the goodness of God.
      We do not see either the piety or the rationality of thus confidently
      expecting that the Supreme Being will interfere to disturb the common
      succession of causes and effects. We, too, rely on his goodness, on his
      goodness as manifested, not in extraordinary interpositions, but in those
      general laws which it has pleased him to establish in the physical and in
      the moral world. We rely on the natural tendency of the human intellect to
      truth, and on the natural tendency of society to improvement. We know no
      well authenticated instance of a people which has decidedly retrograded in
      civilisation and prosperity, except from the influence of violent and
      terrible calamities, such as those which laid the Roman empire in ruins,
      or those which, about the beginning of the sixteenth century, desolated
      Italy. We know of no country which, at the end of fifty years of peace,
      and tolerably good government, has been less prosperous than at the
      beginning of that period. The political importance of a <span
      class="pagenum">184</span><a name="link184" id="link184"></a>state may
      decline, as the balance of power is disturbed by the introduction of new
      forces. Thus the influence of Holland and of Spain is much diminished. But
      are Holland and Spain poorer than formerly? We doubt it. Other countries
      have outrun them. But we suspect that they have been positively, though
      not relatively, advancing. We suspect that Holland is richer than when she
      sent her navies up the Thames, that Spain is richer than when a French
      king was brought captive to the footstool of Charles the Fifth.
    </p>
    <p>
      History is full of the signs of this natural progress of society. We see
      in almost every part of the annals of mankind how the industry of
      individuals, struggling up against wars, taxes, famines, conflagrations,
      mischievous prohibitions, and more mischievous protections, creates faster
      than governments can squander, and repairs whatever invaders can destroy.
      We see the wealth of nations increasing, and all the arts of life
      approaching nearer and nearer to perfection, in spite of the grossest
      corruption and the wildest profusion on the part of rulers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present moment is one of great distress. But how small will that
      distress appear when we think over the history of the last forty years; a
      war, compared with which all other wars sink into insignificance;
      taxation, such as the most heavily taxed people of former times could not
      have conceived; a debt larger than all the public debts that ever existed
      in the world added together; the food of the people studiously rendered
      dear; the currency imprudently debased, and imprudently restored. Yet is
      the country poorer than in 1790? We firmly believe that, in spite of all
      the mis-government of her rulers, she has been almost constantly becoming
      richer and richer. Now and then <span class="pagenum">185</span><a
      name="link185" id="link185"></a>there has been a stoppage, now and then a
      short retrogression; but as to the general tendency there can be no doubt.
      A single breaker may recede; but the tide is evidently coming in.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we were to prophesy that in the year 1980 a population of fifty
      millions, better fed, clad, and lodged than the English of our time, will
      cover these islands, that Sussex and Huntingdonshire will be wealthier
      than the wealthiest parts of the West Riding of Yorkshire now are, that
      cultivation, rich as that of a flower-garden, will be carried up to the
      very tops of Ben Nevis and Helvellyn, that machines constructed on
      principles yet undiscovered will be in every house, that there will be no
      highways but railroads, no travelling but by steam, that our debt, vast as
      it seems to us, will appear to our great-grandchildren a trifling
      encumbrance, which might easily be paid off in a year or two, many people
      would think us insane. We prophesy nothing; but this we say: If any person
      had told the Parliament which met in perplexity and terror after the crash
      in 1720 that in 1880 the wealth of England would surpass all their wildest
      dreams, that the annual revenue would equal the principal of that debt
      which they considered as an intolerable burden, that for one man of ten
      thousand pounds then living there would be five men of fifty thousand
      pounds, that London would be twice as large and twice as populous, and
      that nevertheless the rate of mortality would have diminished to one half
      of what it then was, that the post-office would bring more into the
      exchequer than the excise and customs had brought in together under
      Charles the Second, that stage-coaches would run from London to York in
      twenty-four hours, that men would be in the habit of sailing without wind,
      and would be beginning <span class="pagenum">186</span><a
      name="link186_rdquo_________id_" id="link186_rdquo_________id_"></a>to
      ride without horses, our ancestors would have given as much credit to the
      prediction as they gave to Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels. Yet the prediction
      would have been true; and they would have perceived that it was not
      altogether absurd, if they had considered that the country was then
      raising every year a sum which would have purchased the fee-simple of the
      revenue of the Plantagenets, ten times what supported the government of
      Elizabeth, three times what, in the time of Oliver Cromwell, had been
      thought intolerably oppressive. To almost all men the state of things
      under which they have been used to live seems to be the necessary state of
      things. We have heard it said that five per cent, is the natural interest
      of money, that twelve is the natural number of a jury, that forty
      shillings is the natural qualification of a county voter. Hence it is
      that, though in every age everybody knows that up to his own time
      progressive improvement has been taking place, nobody seems to reckon on
      any improvement during the next generation. We cannot absolutely prove
      that those are in error who tell us that society has reached a turning
      point, that we have seen our best days. But so said all who came before
      us, and with just as much apparent reason. &ldquo;A million a year will
      beggar us,&rdquo; said the patriots of 1640. &ldquo;Two millions a year
      will grind the country to powder,&rdquo; was the cry in 1660, &ldquo;Six
      millions a year, and a debt of fifty millions!&rdquo; exclaimed Swift;
      &ldquo;the high allies have been the ruin of us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred and forty millions of debt!&rdquo; said Junius; &ldquo;well
      may we say that we owe Lord Chatham more than we shall ever pay, if we owe
      him such a load as this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred and forty millions of debt!&rdquo; cried all the
      statesmen of 1783 in chorus; &ldquo;what abilities, or what <span
      class="pagenum">187</span><a name="link187" id="link187"></a>economy on
      the part of a minister, can save a country so burdened?&rdquo; We know
      that if, since 1783, no fresh debt had been incurred, the increased
      resources of the country would have enabled us to defray that debt at
      which Pitt, Fox, and Burke stood aghast, nay, to defray it over and over
      again, and that with much lighter taxation than what we have actually
      borne. On what principle is it that, when we see nothing but improvement
      behind us, we are to expect nothing but deterioration before us?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not by the intermeddling of Mr. Southey&rsquo;s idol, the omniscient
      and omnipotent State, but by the prudence and energy of the people, that
      England has hitherto been carried forward in civilisation; and it is to
      the same prudence and the same energy that we now look with comfort and
      good hope. Our rulers will best promote the improvement of the nation by
      strictly confining themselves to their own legitimate duties, by leaving
      capital to find its most lucrative course, commodities their fair price,
      industry and intelligence their natural reward, idleness and folly their
      natural punishment, by maintaining peace, by defending property, by
      diminishing the price of law, and by observing strict economy in every
      department of the state. Let the Government do this: the People will
      assuredly do the rest.

      A pious Brahmin, it is written, made a vow that on a certain day he would
      sacrifice a sheep, and on the appointed morning he went forth to buy one.
      There lived in his neighbourhood three rogues who knew of his vow, and
      laid a scheme for profiting by it. The first met him and said, &ldquo;Oh
      Brahmin, wilt thou buy a sheep? I have one fit for sacrifice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for that very purpose,&rdquo; said the holy man, &ldquo;that
      I came forth this day.&rdquo; Then the impostor opened a bag, and brought
      out of it an unclean beast, an ugly dog, lame and blind. Thereon the
      Brahmin cried out, &ldquo;Wretch, who touchest things impure, and utterest
      things untrue, callest thou that cur a sheep?&rdquo; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo;
      answered the other, &ldquo;it is a sheep of the finest fleece, and of the

      flesh. Oh Brahmin, it will be an offering most acceptable to the gods.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said the Brahmin, &ldquo;either thou or I must be
      blind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then one of the accomplice&rsquo;s came up. &ldquo;Praised be the
      gods,&rdquo; said this second rogue, &ldquo;that I have been saved the
      trouble of going to the market for a sheep! This is such a sheep as I
      wanted. For how much wilt thou sell it?&rdquo; When the Brahmin heard
      this, his mind waved to and fro, like one swinging in the air at a holy
      festival. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he to the new comer, &ldquo;take heed
      what thou dost; this is no sheep, but an unclean cur.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Brahmin,&rdquo; said the new comer, &ldquo;thou art drunk or
      mad!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time the third confederate drew near. &ldquo;Let us ask this man,&rdquo;
      said the Brahmin, &ldquo;what the creature is, and I will stand by what he
      shall say.&rdquo; To this the others agreed; and the Brahmin called out,
      &ldquo;Oh stranger, what dost thou call this beast?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, oh Brahmin,&rdquo; said the knave, &ldquo;it is a fine
      sheep.&rdquo; Then the Brahmin said, &ldquo;Surely the gods have taken
      away my senses;&rdquo; and he asked pardon of him who carried the dog, and
      bought it for a measure of rice and a pot of ghee, and offered it up to
      the gods, who, being wroth at this unclean sacrifice, smote him with a
      sore disease in all his joints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, or nearly thus, if we remember rightly, runs the story of the
      Sanscrit √Üsop. The moral, like the moral of every fable that is worth the
      telling, lies on the surface. The writer evidently means to caution us
      against the practices of puffers, a class of people who have more than
      once talked the public into the most absurd errors, but who surely never
      played a more curious or a more difficult trick than when they passed Mr.
      Robert Montgomery off upon the world as a great poet. <span class="pagenum">190</span><a
      name="link190" id="link190"></a>In an age in which there are so few
      readers that a writer cannot subsist on the sum arising from the sale of
      his works, no man who has not an independent fortune can devote himself to
      literary pursuits, unless he is assisted by patronage. In such an age,
      accordingly, men of letters too often pass their lives in dangling at the
      heels of the wealthy and powerful; and all the faults which dependence
      tends to produce, pass into their character. They become the parasites and
      slaves of the great. It is melancholy to think how many of the highest and
      most exquisitely formed of human intellects have been condemned to the
      ignominious labour of disposing the commonplaces of adulation in new forms
      and brightening them into new splendour. Horace invoking Augustus in the
      most enthusiastic language of religious veneration, Statius flattering a
      tyrant, and the minion of a tyrant, for a morsel of bread, Ariosto
      versifying the whole genealogy of a niggardly patron, Tasso extolling the
      heroic virtues of the wretched creature who locked him up in a mad-house,
      these are but a few of the instances which might easily be given of the
      degradation to which those must submit who, not possessing a competent
      fortune, are resolved to write when there are scarcely any who read.
    </p>
    <p>
      This evil the progress of the human mind tends to remove. As a taste for
      books becomes more and more common, the patronage of individuals becomes
      less and less necessary. In the middle of the last century a marked change
      took place. The tone of literary men, both in this country and in France,
      became higher and more independent. Pope boasted that he was the &ldquo;one
      poet&rdquo; who had &ldquo;pleased by manly ways;&rdquo; he derided the
      soft dedications with which Halifax had been fed, asserted his own
      superiority over the pensioned Boileau, <span class="pagenum">191</span><a
      name="link191_rdquo_________id_" id="link191_rdquo_________id_"></a>and
      gloried in being not the follower, but the friend, of nobles and princes.
      The explanation of all this is very simple. Pope was the first Englishman
      who, by the mere sale of his writings, realised a sum which enabled him to
      live in comfort and in perfect independence. Johnson extols him for the
      magnanimity which he showed in inscribing his Iliad not to a minister or a
      peer, but to Congreve. In our time this would scarcely be a subject for
      praise. Nobody is astonished when Mr. Moore pays a compliment of this kind
      to Sir Walter Scott, or Sir Walter Scott to Mr. Moore. The idea of either
      of those gentlemen looking out for some lord who would be likely to give
      him a few guineas in return for a fulsome dedication seems laughably
      incongruous. Yet this is exactly what Dryden or Otway would have done; and
      it would be hard to blame them for it. Otway is said to have been choked
      with a piece of bread which he devoured in the rage of hunger; and,
      whether this story be true or false, he was beyond all question miserably
      poor. Dryden, at near seventy, when at the head of the literary men of
      England, without equal or second, received three hundred pounds for his
      Fables, a collection of ten thousand verses, and of such verses as no man
      then living, except himself, could have produced. Pope, at thirty, had
      laid up between six and seven thousand pounds, the fruits of his poetry.
      It was not, we suspect, because he had a higher spirit or a more
      scrupulous conscience than his predecessors, but because he had a larger
      income, that he kept up the dignity of the literary character so much
      better than they had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the time of Pope to the present day the readers have been constantly
      becoming more and more numerous, and the writers, consequently, more and
      more <span class="pagenum">192</span><a name="link192" id="link192"></a>independent.
      It is assuredly a great evil that men, fitted by their talents and
      acquirements to enlighten and charm the world, should be reduced to the
      necessity of flattering wicked and foolish patrons in return for the
      sustenance of life. But, though we heartily rejoice that this evil is
      removed, we cannot but see with concern that another evil has succeeded to
      it. The public is now the patron, and a most liberal patron. All that the
      rich and powerful bestowed on authors from the the time of M√¶cenas to that
      of Harley would not, we apprehend, make up a sum equal to that which has
      been paid by English booksellers to authors during the last fifty years.
      Men of letters have accordingly ceased to court individuals, and have
      begun to court the public. They formerly used flattery. They now use
      puffing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the old or the new vice be the worse, whether those who formerly
      lavished insincere praise on others, or those who now contrive by every
      art of beggary and bribery to stun the public with praises of themselves,
      disgrace their vocation the more deeply, we shall not attempt to decide.
      But of this we are sure, that it is high time to make a stand against the
      new trickery. The puffing of books is now so shamefully and so
      successfully carried on that it is the duty of all who are anxious for the
      purity of the national taste, or for the honour of the literary character,
      to join in discountenancing the practice. All the pens that ever were
      employed in magnifying Bish&rsquo;s lucky office, Romanis&rsquo;s fleecy
      hosiery, Packwood&rsquo;s razor strops, and Rowland&rsquo;s Kalydor, all
      the placard-bearers of Dr. Eady, all the wall-chalkers of Day and Martin,
      seem to have taken service with the poets and novelists of this
      generation. Devices which in the lowest trades <span class="pagenum">193</span><a
      name="link193_rdquo_________id_" id="link193_rdquo_________id_"></a>are
      considered as disreputable are adopted without scruple, and improved upon
      with a despicable ingenuity, by people engaged in a pursuit which never
      was and never will be considered as a mere trade by any man of honour and
      virtue. A butcher of the higher class disdains to ticket his meat. A
      mercer of the higher class would be ashamed to hang up papers in his
      window inviting the passers-by to look at the stock of a bankrupt, all of
      the first quality, and going for half the value. We expect some reserve,
      some decent pride, in our hatter and our bootmaker. But no artifice by
      which notoriety can be obtained is thought too abject for a man of
      letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is amusing to think over the history of most of the publications which
      have had a run during the last few years. The publisher is often the
      publisher of some periodical work. In this periodical work the first
      flourish of trumpets is sounded. The peal is then echoed and re-echoed by
      all the other periodical works over which the publisher, or the author, or
      the author&rsquo;s coterie, may have any influence. The newspapers are for
      a fortnight filled with puffs of all the various kinds which Sheridan
      enumerated, direct, oblique, and collusive. Sometimes the praise is laid
      on thick for simple-minded people. &ldquo;Pathetic,&rdquo; &ldquo;sublime,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;splendid,&rdquo; &ldquo;graceful,&rdquo; &ldquo;brilliant wit,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;exquisite humour,&rdquo; and other phrases equally flattering,
      fall, in a shower as thick and as sweet as the sugar-plums at a Roman
      carnival. Sometimes greater art is used. A sinecure has been offered to
      the writer if he would suppress his work, or if he would even soften down
      a few of his incomparable portraits. A distinguished military and
      political character has challenged the inimitable satirist of the vices of
      the great; and the puffer is glad to <span class="pagenum">194</span><a
      name="link194" id="link194"></a>learn that the parties have been bound
      over to keep the peace. Sometimes it is thought expedient that the puffer
      should put on a grave face, and utter his panegyric in the form of
      admonition. &ldquo;Such attacks on private character cannot be too much
      condemned. Even the exuberant wit of our author, and the irresistible
      power of his withering sarcasm, are no excuses for that utter disregard
      which he manifests for the feelings of others. We cannot but wonder that a
      winter of such transcendent talents, a writer who is evidently no stranger
      to the kindly charities and sensibilities of our nature, should show so
      little tenderness to the foibles of noble and distinguished individuals,
      with whom it is clear, from every page of his work, that he must have been
      constantly mingling in society.&rdquo; These are but tame and feeble
      imitations of the paragraphs with which the daily papers are filled
      whenever an attorney&rsquo;s clerk or an apothecary&rsquo;s assistant
      undertakes to tell the public in bad English and worse French, how people
      tie their neckcloths and eat their dinners in Grosvenor Square. The
      editors of the higher and more respectable newspapers usually prefix the
      words &ldquo;Advertisement,&rdquo; or &ldquo;From a Correspondent,&rdquo;
      to such paragraphs. But this makes little difference. The panegyric is
      extracted, and the significant heading omitted. The fulsome eulogy makes
      its appearance on the covers of all the Reviews and Magazines, with
      &ldquo;Times&rdquo; or &ldquo;Globe&rdquo; affixed, though the editors of
      the Times and the Globe have no more to do with it than with Mr. Goss&rsquo;s
      way of making old rakes young again.
    </p>
    <p>
      That people who live by personal slander should practise these arts is not
      surprising. Those who stoop to write calumnious books may well stoop to
      puff them; <span class="pagenum">195</span><a name="link195" id="link195"></a>and
      that the basest of all trades should be carried on in the basest of all
      manners is quite proper and as it should be. But how any man who has the
      least self-respect, the least regard for his own personal dignity, can
      condescend to persecute the public with this Rag-fair importunity, we do
      not understand. Extreme poverty may, indeed, in some degree, be an excuse
      for employing these shifts, as it may be an excuse for stealing a leg of
      mutton. But we really think that a man of spirit and delicacy would quite
      as soon satisfy his wants in the one way as in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no excuse for an author that the praises of journalists are procured
      by the money or influence of his publishers, and not by his own. It is his
      business to take such precautions as may prevent others from doing what
      must degrade him. It is for his honour as a gentleman, and, if he is
      really a man of talents, it will eventually be for his honour and interest
      as a writer, that his works should come before the public recommended by
      their own merits alone, and should be discussed with perfect freedom. If
      his objects be really such as he may own without shame, he will find that
      they will, in the long run, be better attained by suffering the voice of
      criticism to be fairly heard. At present, we too often see a writer
      attempting to obtain literary fame as Shakspeare&rsquo;s usurper obtains
      sovereignty. The publisher plays Buckingham to the author&rsquo;s Richard.
      Some few creatures of the conspiracy are dexterously disposed here and
      there in the crowd. It is the business of these hirelings to throw up
      their caps, and clap their hands, and utter their <i>vivas</i>. The rabble
      at first stare and wonder, and at last join in shouting for shouting&rsquo;s
      sake; and thus a crown is placed on a head which has no right to it, by
      the huzzas of a few servile dependents. <span class="pagenum">196</span><a
      name="link196" id="link196"></a>The opinion of the great body of the
      reading public is very materially influenced even by the unsupported
      assertions of those who assume a right to criticize. Nor is the public
      altogether to blame on this account. Most even of those who have really a
      great enjoyment in reading are in the same state, with respect to a book,
      in which a man who has never given particular attention to the art of
      painting is with respect to a picture. Every man who has the least
      sensibility or imagination derives a certain pleasure from pictures. Yet a
      man of the highest and finest intellect might, unless he had formed his
      taste by contemplating the best pictures, be easily persuaded by a knot of
      connoisseurs that the worst daub in Somerset House was a miracle of art.
      If he deserves to be laughed at, it is not for his ignorance of pictures,
      but for his ignorance of men. He knows that there is a delicacy of taste
      in painting which he does not possess, that he cannot distinguish hands,
      as practised judges distinguish them, that he is not familiar with the
      finest models, that he has never looked at them with close attention, and
      that, when the general effect of a piece has pleased him or displeased
      him, he has never troubled himself to ascertain why. When, therefore,
      people, whom he thinks more competent to judge than himself, and of whose
      sincerity he entertains no doubt, assure him that a particular work is
      exquisitely beautiful, he takes it for granted that they must be in the
      right. He returns to the examination, resolved to find or imagine
      beauties; and, if he can work himself up into something like admiration,
      he exults in his own proficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just such is the manner in which nine readers out of ten judge of a book.
      They are ashamed to dislike what men who speak as having authority declare
      to be good. At present, however contemptible a poem <span class="pagenum">197</span><a
      name="link197" id="link197"></a>or a novel may be, there is not the least
      difficulty in procuring favourable notices of it from all sorts of
      publications, daily, weekly, and monthly. In the mean time, little or
      nothing is said on the other side. The author and the publisher are
      interested in crying up the book. Nobody has any very strong interest in
      crying it down. Those who are best fitted to guide the public opinion
      think it beneath them to expose mere nonsense, and comfort themselves by
      reflecting that such popularity cannot last. This contemptuous lenity has
      been carried too far. It is perfectly true that reputations which have
      been forced into an unnatural bloom fade almost as soon as they have
      expanded; nor have we any apprehensions that puffing will ever raise any
      scribbler to the rank of a classic. It is indeed amusing to turn over some
      late volumes of periodical works, and to see how many immortal productions
      have, within a few months, been gathered to the Poems of Blackmore and the
      novels of Mrs. Behn; how many &ldquo;profound views of human nature,&rdquo;
      and &ldquo;exquisite delineations of fashionable manners,&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;vernal, and sunny, and refreshing thoughts,&rdquo; and &ldquo;high
      imaginings,&rdquo; and &ldquo;young breathings,&rdquo; and &ldquo;embody-ings,&rdquo;
      and &ldquo;pinings,&rdquo; and &ldquo;minglings with the beauty of the
      universe,&rdquo; and &ldquo;harmonies which dissolve the soul in a
      passionate sense of loveliness and divinity,&rdquo; the world has
      contrived to forget. The names of the books and of the writers are buried
      in as deep an oblivion as the name of the builder of Stonehenge. Some of
      the well puffed fashionable novels of eighteen hundred and twenty-nine
      hold the pastry of eighteen hundred and thirty; and others, which are now
      extolled in language almost too high-flown for the merits of Don Quixote,
      will, we have no doubt, line the trunks of eighteen <span class="pagenum">198</span><a
      name="link198_rdquo_________id_" id="link198_rdquo_________id_"></a>hundred
      and thirty-one. But, though we have no apprehensions that puffing will
      ever confer permanent reputation on the undeserving, we still think its
      influence most pernicious. Men of real merit will, if they persevere, at
      last reach the station to which they are entitled, and intruders will be
      ejected with contempt and derision. But it is no small evil that the
      avenues to fame should be blocked up by a swarm of noisy, pushing,
      elbowing pretenders, who, though they will not ultimately be able to make
      good their own entrance, hinder, in the mean time, those who have a right
      to enter. All who will not disgrace themselves by joining in the unseemly
      scuffle must expect to be at first hustled and shouldered back. Some men
      of talents, accordingly, turn away in dejection from pursuits in which
      success appears to bear no proportion to desert. Others employ in
      self-defence the means by which competitors, far inferior to themselves,
      appear for a time to obtain a decided advantage. There are few who have
      sufficient confidence in their own powers and sufficient elevation of mind
      to wait with secure and contemptuous patience, while dunce after dunce
      presses before them. Those who will not stoop to the baseness of the
      modern fashion are too often discouraged. Those who stoop to it are always
      degraded.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have of late observed with great pleasure some symptoms which lead us
      to hope that respectable literary men of all parties are beginning to be
      impatient of this insufferable nuisance. And we purpose to do what in us
      lies for the abating of it. We do not think that we can more usefully
      assist in this good work than by showing our honest countrymen what that
      sort of poetry is which puffing can drive through eleven editions, and how
      easy any bellman might, if a bellman <span class="pagenum">199</span><a
      name="link199" id="link199"></a>would stoop to the necessary degree of
      meanness, become a &ldquo;master-spirit of the age.&rdquo; We have no
      enmity to Mr. Robert Montgomery. We know nothing whatever about him,
      except what we have learned from his books, and from the portrait prefixed
      to one of them, in which he appears to be doing his very best to look like
      a man of genius and sensibility, though with less success than his
      strenuous exertions deserve. We select him, because his works have
      received more enthusiastic praise, and have deserved more unmixed
      contempt, than any which, as far as our knowledge extends, have appeared
      within the last three or four years. His writing bears the same relation
      to poetry which a Turkey carpet bears to a picture. There are colours in a
      Turkey carpet out of which a picture might be made. There are words in Mr.
      Montgomery&rsquo;s writing which, when disposed in certain orders and
      combinations, have made, and will again make, good poetry. But, as they
      now stand, they seem to be put together on principle in such a manner as
      to give no image of any thing &ldquo;in the heavens above, or in the earth
      beneath, or in the waters under the earth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The poem on the Omnipresence of the Deity commences with a description of
      the creation, in which we can find only one thought which has the least
      pretension to ingenuity, and that one thought is stolen from Dryden, and
      marred in the stealing; <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"Last, softly
      beautiful as music&rsquo;s close, <br /><span class="indent20">Angelic
      woman into being rose.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The all-pervading influence of the Supreme Being is then described in a
      few tolerable lines borrowed from Pope, and a great many intolerable lines
      of Mr. Robert <span class="pagenum">200</span><a
      name="link200_rdquo_________id_" id="link200_rdquo_________id_"></a>Montgomery&rsquo;s
      own. The following may stand as a specimen: <br /><br /><span
      class="indent20">"But who could trace Thine unrestricted course, <br /><span
      class="indent20">Though Fancy follow&rsquo;d with immortal force? <br /><span
      class="indent20">There&rsquo;s not a blossom fondled by the breeze, <br /><span
      class="indent20">There&rsquo;s not a fruit that beautifies the trees,
      <br /><span class="indent20">There&rsquo;s not a particle in sea or air,
      <br /><span class="indent20">But nature owns thy plastic influence there!
      <br /><span class="indent20">With fearful gaze, still be it mine to see
      <br /><span class="indent20">How all is fill&rsquo;d and vivified by Thee;
      <br /><span class="indent20">Upon thy mirror, earth&rsquo;s majestic view,
      <br /><span class="indent20">To paint Thy Presence, and to feel it too.&rdquo;
      </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The last two lines contain an excellent specimen of Mr. Robert Montgomery&rsquo;s
      Turkey-carpet style of writing. The majestic view of earth is the mirror
      of God&rsquo;s presence; and on this mirror Mr. Robert Montgomery paints
      God&rsquo;s presence. The use of a mirror, we submit, is not to be painted
      upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few more lines, as bad as those which we have quoted, bring us to one of
      the most amusing instances of literary pilfering which we remember. It
      might be of use to plagiarists to know, as a general rule, that what they
      steal is, to employ a phrase common in advertisements, of no use to any
      but the right owner. We never fell in, however, with any plunderer who so
      little understood how to turn his booty to good account as Mr. Montgomery.
      Lord Byron, in a passage which every body knows by heart, has said,
      addressing the sea, <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"Time writes no
      wrinkle on thine azure brow.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert Montgomery very coolly appropriates the image and reproduces
      the stolen goods in the following form: <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"And
      thou, vast Ocean, on whose awful face <br /><span class="indent20">Time&rsquo;s
      iron feet can print no ruin-trace.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So may such ill got gains ever prosper! <span class="pagenum">201</span><a
      name="link201" id="link201"></a>The effect which the Ocean produces on
      Atheists is then described in the following: lofty lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      O v <br /><span class="indent20">"Oh! never did the dark-soul&rsquo;d
      Atheist stand, <br /><span class="indent20">And watch the breakers boiling
      on the strand, <br /><span class="indent20">And, while Creation stagger&rsquo;d
      at his nod, <br /><span class="indent20">Mock the dread presence of the
      mighty God! <br /><span class="indent20">We hear Him in the wind-heaved
      ocean&rsquo;s roar, <br /><span class="indent20">Hurling her billowy crags
      upon the shore; <br /><span class="indent20">We hear Him in the riot of the
      blast, <br /><span class="indent20">And shake, while rush the raving
      whirlwinds past!&rdquo; </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Robert Montgomery&rsquo;s genius were not far too free and aspiring
      to be shackled by the rules of syntax, we should suppose that it is at the
      nod of the Atheist that creation staggers. But Mr. Robert Montgomery&rsquo;s
      readers must take such grammar as they can get, and be thankful.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few more lines bring us to another instance of unprofitable theft. Sir
      Walter Scott has these lines in the Lord of the Isles: <br /><br /><span
      class="indent25">"The dew that on the violet lie? <br /><span
      class="indent25">Mocks the dark lustre of thine eyes.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is pretty taken separately, and, as is always the case with the good
      things of good writers, much prettier in its place than can even be
      conceived by those who see it only detached from the context. Now for Mr.
      Montgomery: <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"And the bright dew-bead on
      the bramble lies, <br /><span class="indent20">Like liquid rapture upon
      beauty&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The comparison of a violet, bright with the dew, to a woman&rsquo;s eyes,
      is as perfect as a comparison can be. Sir Walter&rsquo;s lines are part of
      a song addressed to a woman at daybreak, when the violets are bathed in
      dew; and the comparison is therefore peculiarly natural and graceful. Dew
      on a bramble is no more like a woman&rsquo;s eyes than dew anywhere else.
      There is a very <span class="pagenum">202</span><a name="link202"
      id="link202"></a>pretty Eastern tale of which the fate of plagiarists
      often reminds us. The slave of a magician saw his master wave his wand,
      and heard him give orders to the spirits who arose at the summons. The
      slave stole the wand, and waved it himself in the air; but he had not
      observed that his master used the left hand for that purpose. The spirits
      thus irregularly summoned tore the thief to pieces instead of obeying his
      orders. There are very few who can safely venture to conjure with the rod
      of Sir Walter; and Mr. Robert Montgomery is not one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Campbell, in one of his most pleasing pieces, has this line, <br /><br /><span
      class="indent20">"The sentinel stars set their watch in the sky.&rdquo;
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought is good, and has a very striking propriety where Mr. Campbell
      has placed it, in the mouth of a soldier telling his dream. But, though
      Shakspeare assures us that &ldquo;every true man&rsquo;s apparel fits your
      thief,&rdquo; it is by no means the case, as we have already seen, that
      every true poet&rsquo;s similitude fits your plagiarist. Let us see how
      Mr. Robert Montgomery uses the image: <br /><br /><span class="indent20">Ye
      quenchless stars! so eloquently bright, <br /><span class="indent20">Untroubled
      sentries of the shadowy night, <br /><span class="indent20">While half the
      world is lapp&rsquo;d in downy dreams, <br /><span class="indent20">And
      round the lattice creep your midnight beams, <br /><span class="indent20">How
      sweet to gaze upon your placid eyes, <br /><span class="indent20">In
      lambent beauty looking from the skies.&rdquo; </span></span></span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly the ideas of eloquence, of untroubled repose, of placid eyes, on
      the lambent beauty of which it is sweet to gaze, harmonize admirably with
      the idea of a sentry.
    </p>
    <p>
      We would not be understood, however, to say, that Mr. Robert Montgomery
      cannot make similitudes for himself. A very few lines further on, we find
      one <span class="pagenum">203</span><a name="link203" id="link203"></a>which
      has every mark of originality, and on which, we will be bound, none of the
      poets whom he has plundered will ever think of making reprisals: <br /><br /><span
      class="indent20">"The soul, aspiring, pants its source to mount, <br /><span
      class="indent20">As streams meander level with their fount.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We take this to be, on the whole, the worst similitude in the world. In
      the first place, no stream meanders, or can possibly meander, level with
      its fount. In the next place, if streams did meander level with their
      founts, no two motions can be less like each other than that of meandering
      level and that of mounting upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have then an apostrophe to the Deity, couched in terms which, in any
      writer who dealt in meanings, we should call profane, but to which we
      suppose Mr. Robert Montgomery attaches no idea whatever. <br /><br /><span
      class="indent20">"Yes! pause and think, within one fleeting hour, <br /><span
      class="indent20">How vast a universe obeys Thy power; <br /><span
      class="indent20">Unseen, but felt, Thine interfused control <br /><span
      class="indent20">Works in each atom, and pervades the whole; <br /><span
      class="indent20">Expands the blossom, and erects the tree, <br /><span
      class="indent20">Conducts each vapour, and commands each sea, <br /><span
      class="indent20">Beams in each ray, bids whirlwinds be unfurl&rsquo;d,
      <br /><span class="indent20">Unrolls the thunder, and upheaves a world!&rdquo;
      </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      No field-preacher surely ever carried his irreverent familiarity so far as
      to bid the Supreme Being stop and think on the importance of the interests
      which are under his care. The grotesque indecency of such an address
      throws into shade the subordinate absurdities of the passage, the
      unfurling of whirlwinds, the unrolling of thunder, and the upheaving of
      worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then comes a curious specimen of our poet&rsquo;s English: <br /><br /><span
      class="indent25">"Yet not alone created realms engage <br /><span
      class="indent25">Thy faultless wisdom, grand, primeval sage! <br /><span
      class="indent25">For all the thronging woes to life allied <br /><span
      class="indent25">Thy mercy tempers, and Thy cares provide.&rdquo; </span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">204</span><a name="link204" id="link204"></a>We
      should be glad to know what the word &ldquo;For&rdquo; means here. If it
      is a preposition, it makes nonsense of the words, &ldquo;Thy mercy
      tempers.&rdquo; If it is an adverb, it makes nonsense of the words,
      &ldquo;Thy cares provide.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These beauties we have taken, almost at random, from the first part of the
      poem. The second part is a series of descriptions of various events, a
      battle, a murder, an execution, a marriage, a funeral, and so forth. Mr.
      Robert Montgomery terminates each of these descriptions by assuring us
      that the Deity was present at the battle, murder, execution, marriage, or
      funeral in question. And this proposition, which might be safely
      predicated of every event that ever happened or ever will happen, forms
      the only link which connects these descriptions with the subject or with
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the descriptions are executed our readers are probably by this time
      able to conjecture. The battle is made up of the battles of all ages and
      nations: &ldquo;red-mouthed cannons, uproaring to the clouds,&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;hands grasping firm the glittering shield.&rdquo; The only military
      operations of which this part of the poem reminds us, are those which
      reduced the Abbey of Quedlinburgh to submission, the Templar with his
      cross, the Austrian and Prussian grenadiers in full uniform, and Curtius
      and Dentatus with their battering-ram. We ought not to pass unnoticed the
      slain war-horse, who will no more <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"Roll
      his red eye, and rally for the fight;&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      or the slain warrior who, while &ldquo;lying on his bleeding breast,&rdquo;
      contrives to &ldquo;stare ghastly and grimly on the skies.&rdquo; As to
      this last exploit, we can only say, as Dante did on a similar occasion,
      <br /><br /><span class="indent25">"Forse per forza gia di&rsquo; parlasia
      <br /><span class="indent25">Si stravolse lost alenn del tutto: <br /><span
      class="indent25">Ma i√¥ nol vidi, n√® credo clie sia.&rdquo; </span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">205</span><a name="link205" id="link205"></a>The
      tempest is thus described: <br /><br /><span class="indent15">"But lo!
      around the marsh&rsquo;lling clouds unite, <br /><span class="indent15">Like
      thick battalions halting for the fight; <br /><span class="indent15">The
      sun sinks back, the tempest spirits sweep <br /><span class="indent15">Fierce
      through the air, and flutter on the deep. <br /><span class="indent15">Till
      from their caverns rush the maniac blasts, <br /><span class="indent15">Tear
      the loose sails, and split the creaking masts, <br /><span class="indent15">And
      the lash&rsquo;d billows, rolling in a train, <br /><span class="indent15">Rear
      their white heads, and race along the main!&rdquo; </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      What, we should like to know, is the difference between the two operations
      which Mr. Robert Montgomery so accurately distinguishes from each other,
      the fierce sweeping of the tempest-spirits through the air, and the
      rushing of the maniac blasts from their caverns? And why does the former
      operation end exactly when the latter commences?
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot stop over each of Mr. Robert Montgomery&rsquo;s descriptions. We
      have a shipwrecked sailor, who &ldquo;visions a viewless temple in the
      air;&rdquo; a murderer who stands on a heath, &ldquo;with ashy lips, in
      cold convulsion spread;&rdquo; a pious man, to whom, as he lies in bed at
      night, <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"The panorama of past life
      appears, <br /><span class="indent20">Warms his pure mind, and melts it
      into tears;&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      a traveller, who loses his way, owing to the thickness of the &ldquo;cloud-battalion,&rdquo;
      and the want of &ldquo;heaven-lamps, to beam their holy light.&rdquo; We
      have a description of a convicted felon, stolen from that incomparable
      passage in Crabbe&rsquo;s Borough, which has made many a rough and cynical
      reader cry like a child. We can, however, conscientiously declare that
      persons of the most excitable sensibility may safely venture upon Mr.
      <span class="pagenum">206</span><a name="link206" id="link206"></a>Robert
      Montgomery&rsquo;s version. Then we have the &ldquo;poor, mindless,
      pale-faced maniac boy,&rdquo; who <br /><br /><span class="indent30">Rolls
      his vacant eye, <br /><span class="indent20">To greet the glowing fancies
      of the sky.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      What are the glowing fancies of the sky? And what is the meaning of the
      two lines which almost immediately follow? <br /><br /><span class="indent15">"A
      soulless thing, a spirit of the woods, <br /><span class="indent15">He
      loves to commune with the fields and floods.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      How can a soulless thing be a spirit? Then comes a panegyric on the
      Sunday. A baptism follows; after that a marriage: and we then proceed, in
      due course, to the visitation of the sick, and the burial of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often as Death has been personified, Mr. Montgomery has found something
      new to say about him. <br /><br /><span class="indent15">"O Death! though
      dreadless vanquisher of earth, <br /><span class="indent15">The Elements
      shrank blasted at thy birth! <br /><span class="indent15">Careering round
      the world like tempest wind, <br /><span class="indent15">Martyrs before,
      and victims strew&rsquo;d behind; <br /><span class="indent15">Ages on ages
      cannot grapple thee, <br /><span class="indent15">Dragging the world into
      eternity!&rdquo; </span></span></span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      If there be any one line in this passage about which we are more in the
      dark than about the rest, it is the fourth. What the difference may be
      between the victims and the martyrs, and why the martyrs are to lie before
      Death, and the victims behind him, are to us great mysteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now come to the third part, of which we may say with honest Cassio,
      &ldquo;Why, this is a more excellent song than the other.&rdquo; Mr.
      Robert Montgomery is very severe on the infidels, and undertakes to prove,
      that, as he elegantly expresses it, <br /><br /><span class="indent15"> One
      great Enchanter helm&rsquo;d the harmonious whole&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      What an enchanter has to do with helming, or what a <span class="pagenum">207</span><a
      name="link207" id="link207"></a>helm has to do with harmony, he does not
      explain. He proceeds with his argument thus: <br /><br /><span
      class="indent15">"And dare men dream that dismal Chance has framed <br /><span
      class="indent15">All that the eye perceives, or tongue has named; <br /><span
      class="indent15">The spacious world, and all its wonders, born <br /><span
      class="indent15">Designless, sell-created, and forlorn; <br /><span
      class="indent15">Like to the flashing bubbles on a stream, <br /><span
      class="indent15">Fire from the cloud, or phantom in a dream?&rdquo;
      </span></span></span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We should be sorry to stake our faith in a higher Power on Mr. Robert
      Montgomery&rsquo;s logic. He informs us that lightning is designless and
      self-created. If he can believe this, we cannot conceive why he may not
      believe that the whole universe is designless and self-created. A few
      lines before, he tells us that it is the Deity who bids &ldquo;thunder
      rattle from the skiey deep.&rdquo; His theory is therefore this, that God
      made the thunder, but that the lightning made itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Robert Montgomery&rsquo;s metaphysics are not at present our game.
      He proceeds to set forth the fearful effects of Atheism. <br /><br /><span
      class="indent15">"Then, blood-stain&rsquo;d Murder, bare thy hideous arm,
      <br /><span class="indent15">And thou, Rebellion, welter in thy storm:
      <br /><span class="indent15">Awake, ye spirits of avenging crime; <br /><span
      class="indent15">Burst from your bonds, and battle with the time!&rdquo;
      </span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert Montgomery is fond of personification, and belongs, we need not
      say, to that school of poets who hold that nothing more is necessary to a
      personification in poetry than to begin a word with a capital letter.
      Murder may, without impropriety, bare her arm, as she did long ago, in Mr.
      Campbell&rsquo;s Pleasures of Hope. But what possible motive Rebellion can
      have for weltering in her storm, what avenging crime may be, who its
      spirits may be, why they should burst from their bonds, what their bonds
      may be, why they should battle with the time, what the time may be, and
      <span class="pagenum">208</span><a name="link208" id="link208"></a>what a
      battle between the time and the spirits of avenging crime would resemble,
      we must confess ourselves quite unable to understand. <br /><br /><span
      class="indent20">"And here let Memory turn her tearful glance <br /><span
      class="indent20">On the dark horrors of tumultuous France, <br /><span
      class="indent20">When blood and blasphemy defiled her land, <br /><span
      class="indent20">And fierce Rebellion shook her savage hand.&rdquo;
      </span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Rebellion shakes her own hand, shakes the hand of Memory, or
      shakes the hand of France, or what any one of these three metaphors would
      mean, we know no more than we know what is the sense of the following
      passage: <br /><br /><span class="indent15">"Let the foul orgies of
      infuriate crime <br /><span class="indent15">Picture the raging havoc of
      that time, <br /><span class="indent15">When leagued Rebellion march&rsquo;d
      to kindle man, <br /><span class="indent15">Fright in her rear, and Murder
      in her van. <br /><span class="indent15">And thou, sweet flower of Austria,
      slaughter&rsquo;d Queen, <br /><span class="indent15">Who dropp&rsquo;d no
      tear upon the dreadful scene, <br /><span class="indent15">When gush&rsquo;d
      the life-blood from thine angel form, <br /><span class="indent15">And
      martyr&rsquo;d beauty perish&rsquo;d in the storm, <br /><span
      class="indent15">Once worshipp&rsquo;d paragon of all who saw, <br /><span
      class="indent15">Thy look obedience, and thy smile a law.&rdquo; </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the distinction between the foul orgies and the raging havoc which
      the foul orgies are to picture? Why does Fright go behind Rebellion, and
      Murder before? Why should not Murder fall behind Fright? Or why should not
      all the three walk abreast? We have read of a hero who had <br /><br /><span
      class="indent15">"Amazement in his van, with flight combined, <br /><span
      class="indent15">And Sorrow&rsquo;s faded form, and Solitude behind.&rdquo;
      </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Gray, we suspect, could have given a reason for disposing the allegorical
      attendants of Edward thus. But to proceed, &ldquo;Flower of Austria&rdquo;
      is stolen from Byron. &ldquo;Dropp&rsquo;d&rdquo; is false English.
      &ldquo;Perish&rsquo;d in the storm&rdquo; means nothing at all; and
      &ldquo;thy look obedience&rsquo;&rsquo; means the very reverse of what Mr.
      Robert Montgomery intends to say. <span class="pagenum">209</span><a
      name="link209" id="link209"></a>Our poet then proceeds to demonstrate the
      immortality of the soul: <br /><br /><span class="indent15">"And shall the
      soul, the fount of reason, die, <br /><span class="indent15">When dust and
      darkness round its temple lie? <br /><span class="indent15">Did God breathe
      in it no ethereal fire, <br /><span class="indent15">Dimless and
      quenchless, though the breath expire?&rdquo; </span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The soul is a fountain; and therefore it is not to die, though dust and
      darkness lie round its temple, because an ethereal fire has been breathed
      into it, which cannot be quenched though its breath expire. Is it the
      fountain, or the temple, that breathes, and has fire breathed into it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montgomery apostrophizes the <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"Immortal
      beacons,&mdash;spirits of the just,&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and describes their employments in another world, which are to be, it
      seems, bathing in light, hearing fiery streams flow, and riding on living
      cars of lightning. The deathbed of the sceptic is described with what we
      suppose is meant for energy. We then have the deathbed of a Christian made
      as ridiculous as false imagery and false English can make it. But this is
      not enough. The Day of Judgment is to be described, and a roaring cataract
      of nonsense is poured forth upon this tremendous subject. Earth, we are
      told, is dashed into Eternity. Furnace blazes wheel round the horizon, and
      burst into bright wizard phantoms. Racing hurricanes unroll and whirl
      quivering fire-clouds. The white waves gallop. Shadowy worlds career
      around. The red and raging eye of Imagination is then forbidden to pry
      further. But further Mr. Robert Montgomery persists in prying. The stars
      bound through the airy roar. The unbosomed deep yawns on the ruin. The
      billows of Eternity then begin to advance. <span class="pagenum">210</span><a
      name="link210" id="link210"></a>The world glares in fiery slumber. A car
      comes forward driven by living thunder. <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"Creation
      shudders with sublime dismay, <br /><span class="indent20">And in a blazing
      tempest whirls away.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is fine poetry! This is what ranks its writer with the
      master-spirits of the age! This is what has been described, over and over
      again, in terms which would require some qualification if used respecting
      Paradise Lost! It is too much that this patchwork, made by stitching
      together old odds and ends of what, when new, was but tawdry frippery, is
      to be picked off the dunghill on which it ought to rot, and to be held up
      to admiration as an inestimable specimen of art. And what must we think of
      a system by means of which verses like those which we have quoted, verses
      fit only for the poet&rsquo;s corner of the Morning Post, can produce
      emolument and fame? The circulation of this writer&rsquo;s poetry has been
      greater than that of Southey&rsquo;s Roderick, and beyond all comparison
      greater than that of Cary&rsquo;s Dante or of the best works of Coleridge.
      Thus encouraged Mr. Robert Montgomery has favoured the public with volume
      after volume. We have given so much space to the examination of his first
      and most popular performance that we have none to spare for his Universal
      Prayer, and his smaller poems, which, as the puffing journals tell us,
      would alone constitute a sufficient title to literary immortality. We
      shall pass at once to his last publication, entitled Satan.
    </p>
    <p>
      This poem was ushered into the world with the usual roar of acclamation.
      But the thing was now past a joke. Pretensions so unfounded, so impudent,
      and so successful, had aroused a spirit of resistance. In several
      magazines and reviews, accordingly, Satan has been handled somewhat
      roughly, and the arts of the <span class="pagenum">211</span><a
      name="link211" id="link211"></a>puffers have been exposed with good sense
      and spirit. We shall, therefore, be very concise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the two poems we rather prefer that on the Omnipresence of the Deity,
      for the same reason which induced Sir Thomas More to rank one bad book
      above another. &ldquo;Marry, this is somewhat. This is rhyme. But the
      other is neither rhyme nor reason.&rdquo; Satan is a long soliloquy, which
      the Devil pronounces in five or six thousand lines of bad blank verse,
      concerning geography, polities, newspapers, fashionable society,
      theatrical amusements, Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s novels, Lord Byron&rsquo;s
      poetry, and Mr. Martin&rsquo;s pictures. The new designs for Milton have,
      as was natural, particularly attracted the attention of a personage who
      occupies so conspicuous a place in them. Mr. Martin must be pleased to
      learn that, whatever may be thought of those performances on earth, they
      give full satisfaction in Pand√¶monium, and that he is there thought to
      have hit off the likenesses of the various Thrones and Dominations very
      happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motto to the poem of Satan is taken from the Book of Job: &ldquo;Whence
      comest thou? From going to and fro in the earth, and walking up and down
      in it.&rdquo; And certainly Mr. Robert Montgomery has not failed to make
      his hero go to and fro, and walk up and down. With the exception, however,
      of this propensity to locomotion, Satan has not one Satanic quality. Mad
      Tom had told us that &ldquo;the prince of darkness is a gentleman&rdquo;
      but we had yet to learn that he is a respectable and pious gentleman,
      whose principal fault is that he is something of a twaddle and far too
      liberal of his good advice. That happy change in his character which
      Origen anticipated, and of which Tillotson did not despair, seems to be
      rapidly taking <span class="pagenum">212</span><a name="link212"
      id="link212"></a>place. Bad habits are not eradicated in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not strange, therefore, that so old an offender should now and then
      relapse for a short time into wrong dispositions. But to give him his due,
      as the proverb recommends, we must say that he always returns, after two
      or three lines of impiety, to his preaching style. We would seriously
      advise Mr. Montgomery to omit or alter about a hundred lines in different
      parts of this large volume, and to republish it under the name of &ldquo;Gabriel.&rdquo;
      The reflections of which it consists would come less absurdly, as far as
      there is a more and a less in extreme absurdity, from a good than from a
      bad angel.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can afford room only for a single quotation. We give one taken at
      random, neither worse nor better, as far as we can perceive, than any
      other equal number of lines in the book. The Devil goes to the play, and
      moralises thereon as follows: <br /><br /><span class="indent15">"Music and
      Pomp their mingling spirits shed <br /><span class="indent15">Around me;
      beauties in their cloud-like robes <br /><span class="indent15">Shine
      forth,&mdash;a scenic paradise, it glares <br /><span class="indent15">Intoxication
      through the reeling sense <br /><span class="indent15">Of flush&rsquo;d
      enjoyment. In the motley host <br /><span class="indent15">Three prime
      gradations may be rank&rsquo;d: the first, <br /><span class="indent15">To
      mount upon the wings of Shakspeare&rsquo;s mind, <br /><span
      class="indent15">And win a flash of his Promethean thought,&mdash; <br /><span
      class="indent15">To smile and weep, to shudder, and achieve <br /><span
      class="indent15">A round of passionate omnipotence, <br /><span
      class="indent15">Attend: the second, are a sensual tribe, <br /><span
      class="indent15">Convened to hear romantic harlots sing, <br /><span
      class="indent15">On forms to banquet a lascivious gaze, <br /><span
      class="indent15">While the bright perfidy of wanton eyes <br /><span
      class="indent15">Through brain and spirit darts delicious fire: <br /><span
      class="indent15">The last, a throng most pitiful! who seem, <br /><span
      class="indent15">With their corroded figures, rayless glance, <br /><span
      class="indent15">And death-like struggle of decaying age, <br /><span
      class="indent15">Like painted skeletons in charnel pomp <br /><span
      class="indent15">Set forth to satirize the human kind!&mdash; <br /><span
      class="indent15">How fine a prospect for demoniac view! <br /><span
      class="indent15">&lsquo;Creatures whose souls outbalance worlds awake!&rsquo;
      <br /><span class="indent15">Methinks I hear a pitying angel cry.&rdquo;
      </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">213</span><a name="link213" id="link213"></a>Here we
      conclude. If our remarks give pain to Mr. Robert Montgomery, we are sorry
      for it. But, at whatever cost of pain to individuals, literature must be
      purified from this taint, And, to show that we are not actuated by any
      feelings of personal enmity towards him, we hereby give notice that, as
      soon as any book shall, by means of puffing, reach a second edition, our
      intention is to do unto the writer of it as we have done unto Mr. Robert
      Montgomery.

      SADLER&rsquo;S LAW OF POPULATION. (1)
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, July 1830.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e <span
      class="pagenum">214</span><a name="link214" id="link214"></a>did not
      expect a good book from Mr. Sadler: and it is well that we did not; for he
      has given us a very bad one. The matter of his treatise is extraordinary;
      the manner more extraordinary still. His arrangement is confused, his
      repetitions endless, his style everything which it ought not to be.
      Instead of saying what he has to say with the perspicuity, the precision,
      and the simplicity in which consists the eloquence proper to scientific
      writing, he indulges without measure in vague, bombastic declamation, made
      up of those fine things which boys of fifteen admire, and which everybody,
      who is not destined to be a boy all his life, weeds vigorously out of his
      compositions after five-and-twenty. That portion of his two thick volumes
      which is not made up of statistical tables, consists principally of
      ejaculations, apostrophes, metaphors, similes,&mdash;all the worst of
      their respective kinds. His thoughts are dressed up in this shabby finery
      with so much profusion and so little discrimination, that they remind us
      of a company of wretched strolling players, who have huddled on suits of
      ragged and faded tinsel, taken from a common wardrobe, and fitting neither
      their persons
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

      spectators, in a state of strutting, ranting, painted, gilded beggary.
      &ldquo;Oh, rare Daniels!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Political economist, go and do thou likewise!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear, ye political economists and anti-populationists!&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Population, if not proscribed and worried down by the Cerberean
      dogs of this wretched and cruel system, really does press against the
      level of the means of subsistence, and still elevating that level, it
      continues thus to urge society through advancing stages, till at length
      the strong and resistless hand of necessity presses the secret spring of
      human prosperity, and the portals of Providence fly open, and disclose to
      the enraptured gaze the promised land of contented and rewarded labour.&rdquo;
      These are specimens, taken at random, of Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s eloquence. We
      could easily multiply them; but our readers, we fear, are already inclined
      to cry for mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much blank verse and much rhyme is also scattered through these volumes,
      sometimes rightly quoted, sometimes wrongly,&mdash;sometimes good,
      sometimes insufferable,&mdash;sometimes taken from Shakspeare, and
      sometimes, for aught we know, Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s own. &ldquo;Let man,&rdquo;
      cries the philosopher, &ldquo;take heed how he rashly violates his trust;&rdquo;
      and thereupon he breaks forth into singing as follows: <br /><br /><span

      If these lines are not Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s, we heartily beg <span
      class="pagenum">216</span><a name="link216" id="link216"></a>his pardon
      for our suspicion&mdash;a suspicion which, we acknowledge, ought not to be
      lightly entertained of any human being. We can only say that we never met
      with them before, and that we do not much care how long it may be before
      we meet with them, or with any others like them, again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit of this work is as bad as its style. We never met with a book
      which so strongly indicated that the writer was in a good humour with
      himself, and in a bad humour with everybody else; which contained so much
      of that kind of reproach which is vulgarly said to be no slander, and of
      that kind of praise which is vulgarly said to be no commendation. Mr.
      Malthus is attacked in language which it would be scarcely decent to
      employ respecting Titus Oates. &ldquo;Atrocious,&rdquo; &ldquo;execrable,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;blasphemous,&rdquo; and other epithets of the same kind, are poured
      forth against that able, excellent, and honourable man, with a profusion
      which in the early part of the work excites indignation, but, after the
      first hundred pages, produces mere weariness and nausea. In the preface,
      Mr. Sadler excuses himself on the plea of haste. Two-thirds of his book,
      he tells us, were written in a few months. If any terms have escaped him
      which can be construed into personal disrespect, he shall deeply regret
      that he had not more time to revise them. We must inform him that the tone
      of his book required a very different apology; and that a quarter of a
      year, though it is a short time for a man to be engaged in writing a book,
      is a very long time for a man to be in a passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imputation of being in a passion Mr. Sadler will not disclaim. His is
      a theme, he tells us, on which &ldquo;it were impious to be calm;&rdquo;
      and he boasts that, &ldquo;instead of conforming to the candour of the
      present age, he has <span class="pagenum">217</span><a name="link217"
      id="link217"></a>imitated the honesty of preceding ones, in expressing
      himself with the utmost plainness and freedom throughout.&rdquo; If Mr.
      Sadler really wishes that the controversy about his new principle of
      population should be carried on with all the license of the seventeenth
      century, we can have no personal objections. We are quite as little afraid
      of a contest in which quarter shall be neither given nor taken as he can
      be. But we would advise him seriously to consider, before he publishes the
      promised continuation of his work, whether he be not one of that class of
      writers who stand peculiarly in need of the candour which he insults, and
      who would have most to fear from that unsparing severity which he
      practises and recommends.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is only one excuse for the extreme acrimony with which this book is
      written; and that excuse is but a bad one. Mr. Sadler imagines that the
      theory of Mr. Malthus is inconsistent with Christianity, and even with the
      purer forms of Deism. Now, even had this been the case, a greater degree
      of mildness and self-command than Mr. Sadler has shown would have been
      becoming in a writer who had undertaken to defend the religion of charity.
      But, in fact, the imputation which has been thrown on Mr. Malthus and his
      followers is so absurd as scarcely to deserve an answer. As it appears,
      however, in almost every page of Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s book, we will say a
      few words respecting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sadler describes Mr. Malthus&rsquo;s principle in the following words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>It pronounces that there exists an evil in the principle of
      population; an evil, not accidental, but inherent; not of occasional
      occurrence, but in perpetual operation; not light, transient, or
      mitigated, but productive of miseries, compared with which all those
      inflicted by human institutions, that is to say, by the weakness <span
      class="pagenum">218</span><a name="link218" id="link218"></a>and
      wickedness of man, however instigated, are &lsquo;light: an evil, finally,
      for which there is no remedy save one, which had been long overlooked, and
      which is now enunciated in terms which evince anything rather than
      confidence. It is a principle, moreover, pre-eminently bold, as well as
      &lsquo;clear.&rsquo; With a presumption, to call it by no fitter name, of
      which it may be doubted whether literature, heathen or Christian,
      furnishes a parallel, it professes to trace this supposed evil to its
      source, &lsquo;the laws of nature, which are those of God;&rsquo; thereby
      implying, and indeed asserting, that the law by which the Deity multiplies
      his offspring, and that by which he makes provision for their
      sustentation, are different, and, indeed, irreconcilable</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This theory,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;in the plain apprehension of
      the many, lowers the character of the Deity in that attribute, which, as
      Rousseau has well observed, is the most essential to him, his goodness; or
      otherwise, impugns his wisdom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now nothing is more certain than that there is physical and moral evil in
      the world. Whoever, therefore, believes, as we do most firmly believe, in
      the goodness of God must believe that there is no incompatibility between
      the goodness of God and the existence of physical and moral evil. If,
      then, the goodness of God be not incompatible with the existence of
      physical and moral evil, on what grounds does Mr. Sadler maintain that the
      goodness of God is incompatible with the law of population laid down by
      Mr. Malthus?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there any difference between the particular form of evil which would be
      produced by over-population, and other forms of evil which we know to
      exist in the world? It is, says Mr. Sadler, not a light or transient evil,
      but a great and permanent evil. What then? The question of the origin of
      evil is a question of ay or no,&mdash;not a question of more or less. If
      any explanation can be found by which the slightest inconvenience <span
      class="pagenum">219</span><a name="link219" id="link219"></a>ever
      sustained by any sentient being can be reconciled with the divine
      attribute of benevolence, that explanation will equally apply to the most
      dreadful and extensive calamities that can ever afflict the human race.
      The difficulty arises from an apparent contradiction in terms; and that
      difficulty is as complete in the case of a headache which lasts for an
      hour as in the case of a pestilence which unpeoples an empire,&mdash;in
      the case, of the gust which makes us shiver for a moment as in the case of
      the hurricane in which an Armada is cast away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, according to Mr. Sadler, an instance of presumption unparalleled in
      literature, heathen or Christian, to trace an evil to &ldquo;the laws of
      nature, which are those of God,&rdquo; as its source. Is not hydrophobia
      an evil? And is it not a law of nature that hydrophobia should be
      communicated by the bite of a mad dog? Is not malaria an evil? And is it
      not a law of nature that in particular situations the human frame should
      be liable to malaria? We know that there is evil in the world. If it is
      not to be traced to the laws of nature, how did it come into the world? Is
      it supernatural? And, if we suppose it to be supernatural, is not the
      difficulty of reconciling it with the divine attributes as great as if we
      suppose it to be natural? Or, rather, what do the words natural and
      supernatural mean when applied to the operations of the Supreme Mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sadler has attempted, in another part of his work, to meet these
      obvious arguments, by a distinction without a difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The scourges of human existence, as necessary regulators of the
      numbers of mankind, it is also agreed by some, are not inconsistent with
      the wisdom or benevolence of the Governor of the <span class="pagenum">220</span><a
      name="link220" id="link220"></a>universe; though such think that it is a
      mere after-concern to &lsquo;reconcile the undeniable state of the fact to
      the attributes we assign to the Deity.&rsquo; &lsquo;The purpose of the
      earthquake,&rsquo; say they, &lsquo;the hurricane, the drought, or the
      famine, by which thousands, and sometimes almost millions, of the human
      race, are at once overwhelmed, or left the victims of lingering want, is
      certainly inscrutable.&rsquo; How singular is it that a sophism like this,
      so false, as a mere illustration, should pass for an argument, as it has
      long done! The principle of population is declared to be naturally
      productive of evils to mankind, and as having that constant and manifest
      tendency to increase their numbers beyond the means of their subsistence,
      which has produced the unhappy and disgusting consequences so often
      enumerated. This is, then, its universal tendency or rule. But is there in
      Nature the same constant tendency to these earthquakes, hurricanes,
      droughts, and famines, by which so many myriads, if not millions, are
      overwhelmed or reduced at once to ruin? No; these awful events are strange
      exceptions to the ordinary course of things; their visitations are
      partial, and they occur at distant intervals of time. While Religion has
      assigned to them a very solemn office, Philosophy readily refers them to
      those great and benevolent principles of Nature by which the universe is
      regulated. But were there a constantly operating tendency to these
      calamitous occurrences; did we feel the earth beneath us tremulous, and
      giving ceaseless and certain tokens of the coming catastrophe of nature;
      were the hurricane heard mustering its devastating powers, and perpetually
      muttering around us; were the skies &lsquo;like brass,&rsquo; without a
      cloud to produce one genial drop to refresh the thirsty earth, and famine,
      consequently, visibly on the approach; I say, would such a state of
      things, as resulting from the constant laws of Nature, be &lsquo;reconcilable
      with the attributes we assign to the Deity,&rsquo; or with any attributes
      which in these inventive days could be assigned to him, so as to represent
      him as anything but the tormentor, rather than the kind benefactor, of his
      creatures? Life, in such a condition, would be like the unceasingly
      threatened and miserable existence of Damocles at the table of Dionysius,
      and the tyrant himself the worthy image of the Deity of the
      anti-populationists</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely this is wretched trifling. Is it on the number of bad harvests, or
      of volcanic eruptions, that this <span class="pagenum">221</span><a
      name="link221" id="link221"></a>great question depends? Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s
      piety, it seems, would be proof against one rainy summer, but would be
      overcome by three or four in succession. On the coasts of the
      Mediterranean, where earthquakes are rare, he would be an optimist. South
      America would make him a sceptic, and Java a decided Manichean, To say
      that religion assigns a solemn office to these visitations is nothing to
      the purpose. Why was man so constituted as to need such warnings? It is
      equally unmeaning to say that philosophy refers these events to benevolent
      general laws of nature. In so far as the laws of nature produce evil, they
      are clearly not benevolent. They may produce much good. But why is this
      good mixed with evil? The most subtle and powerful intellects have been
      labouring for centuries to solve these difficulties. The true solution, we
      are inclined to think, is that which has been rather suggested, than
      developed, by Paley and Butler. But there is not one solution which will
      not apply quite as well to the evils of over population as to any other
      evil. Many excellent people think that it is presumptuous to meddle with
      such high questions at all, and that, though there doubtless is an
      explanation, our faculties are not sufficiently enlarged to comprehend
      that explanation. This mode of getting rid of the difficulty, again, will
      apply quite as well to the evils of over-population as to any other evils.
      We are sure that those who humbly confess their inability to expound the
      great enigma act more rationally and more decorously than Mr. Sadler, who
      tells us, with the utmost confidence, which are the means and which the
      ends,&mdash;which the exceptions and which the rules, in the government of
      the universe;&mdash;who consents to bear a little evil without denying the
      divine benevolence, <span class="pagenum">222</span><a
      name="link222_rdquo_________id_" id="link222_rdquo_________id_"></a>but
      distinctly announces that a certain quantity of dry weather or stormy
      weather would force him to regard the Deity as the tyrant of his
      creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great discovery by which Mr. Sadler has, as he conceives, vindicated
      the ways of Providence is enounced with all the pomp of capital letters.
      We must particularly beg that our readers will peruse it with attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>No one fact relative to the human species is more clearly
      ascertained, whether by general observation or actual proof, than that
      their fecundity varies in different communities and countries. The
      principle which effects this variation, without the necessity of those
      cruel and unnatural expedients so frequently adverted to, constitutes what
      I presume to call The Law of Population; and that law may be thus briefly
      enunciated:&mdash; </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prolificness of human beings, otherwise similarly
      CIRCUMSTANCED, VARIES INVERSELY AS THEIR NUMBERS.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The preceding definition may be thus amplified and explained.
      Premising, as a mere truism, that marriages under precisely similar
      circumstances will, on the average, be equally fruitful everywhere, I
      proceed to state, first, that the prolificness of a given number of
      marriages will, all other circumstances being the same, vary in proportion
      to the condensation of the population, so that that prolificness shall be
      greatest where the numbers on an equal space are the fewest, and, on the
      contrary, the smallest where those numbers are the largest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sadler, at setting out, abuses Mr. Malthus for enouncing his theory in
      terms taken from the exact sciences. &ldquo;Applied to the mensuration of
      human fecundity,&rdquo; he tells us, &ldquo;the most fallacious of all
      things is geometrical demonstration;&rdquo; and he again informs us that
      those &ldquo;act an irrational and irreverent part who affect to measure
      the mighty depth of God&rsquo;s mercies by their arithmetic, and to
      demonstrate, by their geometrical ratios, that it is inadequate to receive
      and <span class="pagenum">223</span><a name="link223" id="link223"></a>contain
      the efflux of that fountain of life which is in Him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears, however, that it is not to the use of mathematical words, but
      only to the use of those words in their right senses that Mr. Sadler
      objects. The law of inverse variation, or inverse proportion, is as much a
      part of mathematical science as the law of geometric progression. The only
      difference in this respect between Mr. Malthus and Mr. Sadler is, that Mr.
      Malthus knows what is meant by geometric progression, and that Mr. Sadler
      has not the faintest notion of what is meant by inverse variation. Had he
      understood the proposition which he has enounced with so much pomp, its
      ludicrous absurdity must at once have flashed on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let it be supposed that there is a tract in the back settlements of
      America, or in New South Wales, equal in size to London, with only a
      single couple, a man and his wife, living upon it. The population of
      London, with its immediate suburbs, is now probably about a million and a
      half. The average fecundity of a marriage in London is, as Mr. Sadler
      tells us, 2.35. How many children will the woman in the back settlements
      bear according to Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s theory? The solution of the problem
      is easy. As the population in this tract in the back settlements is to the
      population of London, so will be the number of children born from a
      marriage in London to the number of children born from the marriage of
      this couple in the back settlements. That is to say&mdash; 2:1,500,000::
      2.35:1,762,500.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady will have 1,762,500 children: a large &ldquo;efflux of the
      fountain of life,&rdquo; to borrow Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s sonorous rhetoric,
      as the most philoprogenitive parent could possibly desire. <span
      class="pagenum">224</span><a name="link224" id="link224"></a>But let us,
      instead of putting cases of our own, look at some of those which Mr.
      Sadler has brought forward in support of his theory. The following table,
      he tells us, exhibits a striking proof of the truth of his main position.
      It seems to us to prove only that Mr. Sadler does not know what inverse
      proportion means.

      Is 1 to 160 as 3.66 to 5.48? If Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s principle were just,
      the number of children produced by a marriage at the Cape would be, not
      5.48, but very near 600. Or take America and France. Is 4 to 140 as 4.22
      to 5.22? The number of births to a marriage in North America ought,
      according to this proportion, to be about 150.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sadler states the law of population in England thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where the inhabitants are found to be on the square mile, From 50
      to 100 (2 counties) the births to 100 marriages are 420
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &mdash;100 to 150 (9 counties).... 396
     &mdash;150 to 200 (16 counties)... 390
     &mdash;200 to 250 (4 counties).... 388
     &mdash;250 to 300 (5 counties).... 378
     &mdash;300 to 350 (3 counties).... 353
     &mdash;500 to 600 (2 counties).... 331
     &mdash;4000 and upwards (1 county) 246
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I think it quite reasonable to conclude, that, were there
      <span class="pagenum">225</span><a name="link225" id="link225"></a>not
      another document in existence relative to this subject, the facts thus
      deduced from the census of England are fully sufficient to demonstrate the
      position, that the fecundity of human beings varies inversely as their
      numbers. How, I ask, can it be evaded?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What, we ask, is there to evade? Is 246 to 420 as 50 to 4000? Is 331 to
      396 as 100 to 500? If the law propounded by Mr. Sadler were correct, the
      births to a hundred marriages in the least populous part of England, would
      be, 246 X 4000 50, that is 19,680,&mdash;nearly two hundred children to
      every mother. But we will not carry on these calculations. The absurdity
      of Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s proposition is so palpable that it is unnecessary to
      select particular instances. Let us see what are the extremes of
      population and fecundity in well-known countries. The space which Mr.
      Sadler generally takes is a square mile. The population at the Cape of
      Good Hope is, according to him, one to the square mile. That of London is
      two hundred thousand to the square mile. The number of children at the
      Cape, Mr. Sadler informs us, is 5.48 to a marriage. In London, he states
      it at 2.35 to a marriage. Now how can that of which all the variations lie
      between 2.35 and 5.48 vary, either directly or inversely, as that which
      admits of all the variations between one and two hundred thousand? Mr.
      Sadler evidently does not know the meaning of the word proportion. A
      million is a larger quantity than ten. A hundred is a larger quantity than
      five. Mr. Sadler thinks, therefore, that there is no impropriety in saying
      that a hundred is to five as a million is to ten, or in the inverse ratio
      of ten to a million. He proposes to prove that the fecundity of marriages
      varies in inverse proportion to the density of the population. But all
      that <span class="pagenum">226</span><a name="link226" id="link226"></a>he
      attempts to prove is that, while the population increases from one to a
      hundred and sixty on the square mile, the fecundity will diminish from
      5.48 to 3.66; and that again, while the population increases from one
      hundred and sixty to two hundred thousand on the square mile, the
      fecundity will diminish from 3.66 to 2.35.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposition which Mr. Sadler enounces, without understanding the words
      which he uses, would indeed, if it could be proved, set us at ease as to
      the dangers of over-population. But it is, as we have shown, a proposition
      so grossly absurd that it is difficult for any man to keep his countenance
      while he repeats it. The utmost that Mr. Sadler has ever attempted to
      prove is this,&mdash;that the fecundity of the human race diminishes as
      population becomes more condensed,&mdash;but that the diminution of
      fecundity bears a very small ratio to the increase of population,&mdash;so
      that, while the population on a square mile is multiplied two
      hundred-thousand-fold, the fecundity decreases by little more than
      one-half.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does this principle vindicate the honour of God? Does it hold out any new
      hope or comfort to man? Not at all. We pledge ourselves to show, with the
      utmost strictness of reasoning, from Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s own principles,
      and from facts of the most notorious description, that every consequence
      which follows from the law of geometrical progression, laid down by Mr.
      Mal-thus, will follow from the law, miscalled a law of inverse variation,
      which has been laid down by Mr. Sadler.
    </p>
    <p>
      London is the most thickly peopled spot of its size in the known world.
      Therefore the fecundity of the population of London must, according to Mr.
      Sadler, <span class="pagenum">227</span><a name="link227" id="link227"></a>be
      less than the fecundity of human beings living on any other spot of equal
      size. Mr. Sadler tells us, that &ldquo;the ratios of mortality are
      influenced by the different degrees in which the population is
      condensated; and that, other circumstances being; similar, the relative
      number of deaths in a thinly-populated, or country district, is less than
      that which takes place in towns, and in towns of a moderate size less
      again than that which exists in large and populous cities.&rdquo;
      Therefore the mortality in London must, according to him, be greater than
      in other places. But, though, according to Mr. Sadler, the fecundity is
      less in London than elsewhere, and though the mortality is greater there
      than elsewhere, we find that even in London the number of births greatly
      exceeds the number of deaths. During the ten years which ended with 1820,
      there were fifty thousand more baptisms than burials within the bills of
      mortality. It follows, therefore, that, even within London itself, an
      increase of the population is taking place by internal propagation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if the population of a place in which the fecundity is less and the
      mortality greater than in other places still goes on increasing by
      propagation, it follows that in other places the population will increase,
      and increase still faster. There is clearly nothing in Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s
      boasted law of fecundity which will keep the population from multiplying
      till the whole earth is as thick with human beings as St. Giles&rsquo;s
      parish. If Mr. Sadler denies this, he must hold that, in places less
      thickly peopled than London, marriages may be less fruitful than in
      London, which is directly contrary to his own principles; or that in
      places less thickly peopled than London, and similarly situated, people
      will die faster than in London, which is again directly contrary <span
      class="pagenum">228</span><a name="link228" id="link228"></a>to his own
      principles. Now, if it follows, as it clearly does follow, from Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s
      own doctrines, that the human race might he stowed together by three or
      four hundred to the acre, and might still, as far as the principle of
      propagation is concerned, go on increasing, what advantage, in a religious
      or moral point of view, has his theory over that of Mr. Malthus? The
      principle of Mr. Malthus, says Mr. Sadler, leads to consequences of the
      most frightful description. Be it so. But do not all these consequences
      spring equally from his own principle? Revealed religion condemns Mr.
      Malthus. Be it so. But Mr. Sadler must share in the reproach of heresy.
      The theory of Mr. Malthus represents the Deity as a Dionysius hanging the
      sword over the heads of his trembling slaves. Be it so. But under what
      rhetorical figure are we to represent the Deity of Mr. Sadler?
    </p>
    <p>
      A man who wishes to serve the cause of religion ought to hesitate long
      before he stakes the truth of religion on the event of a controversy
      respecting facts in the physical world. For a time he may succeed in
      making a theory which he dislikes unpopular by persuading the public that
      it contradicts the Scriptures and is inconsistent with the attributes of
      the Deity. But, if at last an overwhelming force of evidence proves this
      maligned theory to be true, what is the effect of the arguments by which
      the objector has attempted to prove that it is irreconcilable with natural
      and revealed religion? Merely this, to make men infidels. Like the
      Israelites, in their battle with the Philistines, he has presumptuously
      and without warrant brought down the ark of God into the camp as a means
      of ensuring victory:&mdash;and the consequence of this profanation is
      that, when the battle is lost, the ark is taken. <span class="pagenum">229</span><a
      name="link229" id="link229"></a>In every age the Church has been cautioned
      against this fatal and impious rashness by its most illustrious members,&mdash;by
      the fervid Augustin, by the subtle Aquinas, by the all-accomplished
      Pascal. The warning has been given in vain. That close alliance which,
      under the disguise of the most deadly enmity, has always subsisted between
      fanaticism and atheism is still unbroken. At one time, the cry was,&mdash;&ldquo;If
      you hold that the earth moves round the sun, you deny the truth of the
      Bible.&rdquo; Popes, conclaves, and religious orders, rose up against the
      Copernican heresy. But, as Pascal said, they could not prevent the earth
      from moving, or themselves from moving along with it. One Bing, however,
      they could do, and they did. They could teach numbers to consider the
      Bible as a collection of old women&rsquo;s stories which the progress of
      civilisation and knowledge was refuting one by one. They had attempted to
      show that the Ptolemaic system was as much a part of Christianity as the
      resurrection of the dead. Was it strange, then, that, when the Ptolemaic
      system became an object of ridicule to every man of education in Catholic
      countries, the doctrine of the resurrection should be in peril? In the
      present generation, and in our own country, the prevailing system of
      geology has been, with equal folly, attacked on the ground that it is
      inconsistent with the Mosaic dates. And here we have Mr. Sadler, out of
      his especial zeal for religion, first proving that the doctrine of
      superfecundity is irreconcilable with the goodness of God, and then laying
      down principles, and stating facts, from which the doctrine of
      superfecundity necessarily follows. This blundering piety reminds us of
      the adventures of a certain missionary who went to convert the inhabitants
      of Madagascar. The good father had <span class="pagenum">230</span><a
      name="link230" id="link230"></a>an audience of the king, and began to
      instruct his majesty in the history of the human race as given in the
      Scriptures. &ldquo;Thus, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;was woman made out of
      the rib of man, and ever since that time a woman has had one rib more than
      a man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, father, you must be mistaken there,&rdquo; said the king.
      &ldquo;Mistaken!&rdquo; said the missionary. &ldquo;It is an indisputable
      fact. My faith upon it! My life upon it!&rdquo; The good man had heard the
      fact asserted by his nurse when he was a child,&mdash;had always
      considered it as a strong confirmation of the Scriptures, and fully
      believed it without having ever thought of verifying it. The king ordered
      a man and woman, the leanest that could be found, to be brought before
      him, and desired his spiritual instructor to count their ribs. The father
      counted over and over, upward and downward, and still found the same
      number in both. He then cleared his throat, stammered, stuttered, and
      began to assure the king that, though he had committed a little error in
      saving that a woman had more ribs than a man, he was quite right in saying
      that the first woman was made out of the rib of the first man. &ldquo;How
      can I tell that?&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;You come to me with a
      strange story, which you say is revealed to you from heaven. I have
      already made you confess that one half of it is a lie: and how can you
      have the face to expect that I shall believe the other half?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We have shown that Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s theory, if it be true, is as much a
      theory of superfecundity as that of Mr. Malthus. But it is not true. And
      from Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s own tables we will prove that it is not true.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fecundity of the human race in England Mr. Sadler rates as follows:&mdash;

</pre>
    <p>
      Having given this table, he begins, as usual, to boast and triumph.
      &ldquo;Were there not another document on the subject in existence,&rdquo;
      says he, &ldquo;the facts thus deduced from the census of England are
      sufficient to demonstrate the position, that the fecundity of human beings
      varies inversely as their numbers.&rdquo; In no case would these facts
      demonstrate that the fecundity of human beings varies inversely as their
      numbers in the right sense of the words inverse variation. But certainly
      they would, &ldquo;if there were no other document in existence,&rdquo;
      appear to indicate something like what Mr. Sadler means by inverse
      variation. Unhappily for him, however, there are other documents in
      existence; and he has himself furnished us with them. We will extract
      another of his tables:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of his inquiries with respect to France he presents in the
      following table:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0238.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Then comes the shout of exultation as regularly as the <i>Gloria Patri</i>
      at the end of a Psalm. &ldquo;Is there any possibility of gainsaying the
      conclusions these facts force upon us; namely that the fecundity of
      marriages is regulated by the density of the population, and inversely to
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly these tables, taken separately, look well for Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s
      theory. He must be a bungling gamester who cannot win when he is suffered
      to pack the cards his own way. We must beg leave to shuffle them a little;
      and we will venture to promise our readers that some curious results will
      follow from the operation. In nine counties of England, says Mr. Sadler,
      in which the population is from 100 to 150 on the square mile, the births
      to 100 marriages are 396. He afterwards expresses some doubts as to the
      accuracy of the documents from which this estimate has been formed, and
      rates the number of births as high as 414. Let him take his choice. We
      will allow him every advantage. <span class="pagenum">233</span><a
      name="link233" id="link233"></a>In the table which we have quoted,
      numbered lxiv., he tells us that in Almondness, where the population is
      267 to the square mile, there are 415 births to 100 marriages. The
      population of Almondness is twice as thick as the population of the nine
      counties referred to in the other table. Yet the number of births to a
      marriage is greater in Almondness than in those counties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, he tells us that in three counties, in which the population was
      from 300 to 350 on the square mile, the births to 100 marriages were 353.
      He afterwards rates them at 375. Again we say, let him take his choice.
      But from his table of the population of Lancashire it appears that, in the
      hundred of Ley-land, where the population is 354 to the square mile, the
      number of births to 100 marriages is 391. Here again we have the marriages
      becoming more fruitful as the population becomes denser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now shuffle the censuses of England and France together. In two
      English counties which contain from fifty to 100 inhabitants on the square
      mile, the births to 100 marriages are, according to Mr. Sadler, 420. But
      in forty-four departments of France, in which there are from one to two
      hecatares to each inhabitant, that is to say, in which the population is
      from 125 to 250, or rather more, to the square mile, the number of births
      to 100 marriages is 423 and a fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, in five departments of France in which there is less than one
      hecatare to each inhabitant, that is to sav, in which the population is
      more than 250 to the square mile, the number of births to 100 marriages is
      414 and a fraction. But, in the four counties of England in which the
      population is from 200 to 250 on the square mile, the number of births to
      100 marriages is, <span class="pagenum">234</span><a
      name="link234_rdquo_________id_" id="link234_rdquo_________id_"></a>according
      to one of Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s tables, only 388, and by his very highest
      estimate no more than 402.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sadler gives us a long table of all the towns of England and Ireland,
      which, he tells us, irrefragably demonstrates his principle. We assert,
      and will prove, that these tables are alone sufficient to upset his whole
      theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very true that in the great towns the number of births to a marriage
      appears to be smaller than in the less populous towns. But we learn some
      other facts from these tables which we should be glad to know how Mr.
      Sadler will explain. We find that the fecundity in towns of fewer than
      3,000 inhabitants is actually much greater than the average fecundity of
      the kingdom, and that the fecundity in towns of between 3,000 and 4,000
      inhabitants is at least as great as the average fecundity of the kingdom.
      The average fecundity of a marriage in towns of fewer than 3,000
      inhabitants is about four; in towns of between 3,000 and 4,000 inhabitants
      it is 3.60. Now the average fecundity of England, when it contained only
      160 inhabitants to a square mile, and when, therefore, according to the
      new law of population, the fecundity must have been greater than it now
      is, was only, according to Mr. Sadler, 3.66 to a marriage. To proceed,&mdash;the
      fecundity of a marriage in the English towns of between 4,000 and 5,000
      inhabitants is stated at 3.56. But, when we turn to Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s
      table of the counties, we find the fecundity of a marriage in Warwickshire
      and Staffordshire rated at only 3.48, and in Lancashire and Surrey at only
      3.41.
    </p>
    <p>
      These facts disprove Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s principle; and the fact on which
      he lays so much stress&mdash;that the fecundity is less in the great towns
      than in the small <span class="pagenum">235</span><a name="link235"
      id="link235"></a>towns&mdash;does not tend in any degree to prove his
      principle. There is not the least reason to believe that the population is
      more dense, <i>on a given space</i>, in London or Manchester than in a
      town of 4,000 inhabitants. But it is quite certain that the population is
      more dense in a town of 4,000 inhabitants than in Warwickshire or
      Lancashire. That the fecundity of Manchester is less than the fecundity of
      Sandwich or Guildford is a circumstance which has nothing whatever to do
      with Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s theory. But that the fecundity of Sandwich is
      greater than the average fecundity of Kent,&mdash;that the fecundity of
      Guildford is greater than the average fecundity of Surrey,&mdash;as from
      his own tables appears to be the case,&mdash;these are facts utterly
      inconsistent with his theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need not here examine why it is that the human race is less fruitful in
      great cities than in small towns or in the open country. The fact has long
      been notorious. We are inclined to attribute it to the same causes which
      tend to abridge human life in great cities,&mdash;to general sickliness
      and want of tone, produced by close air and sedentary employments. Thus
      far, and thus far only, we agree with Mr. Sadler, that, when population is
      crowded together in such masses that the general health and energy of the
      frame are impaired by the condensation, and by the habits attending on the
      condensation, then the fecundity of the race diminishes. But this is
      evidently a check of the same class with war, pestilence, and famine. It
      is a check for the operation of which Mr. Malthus has allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That any condensation which does not affect the general health will affect
      fecundity, is not only not proved&mdash;it is disproved&mdash;by Mr.
      Sadler&rsquo;s own tables. <span class="pagenum">236</span><a
      name="link236_rdquo_________id_" id="link236_rdquo_________id_"></a>Mr.
      Sadler passes on to Prussia, and sums up his information respecting that
      country as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0005" id="linkimage-0005"> </a>
    </p>

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0242.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      After the table comes the boast as usual:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Thus is the law of population deduced from the registers of
      Prussia also; and were the argument to pause here, it is conclusive. The
      results obtained from the registers of this and the preceding countries
      exhibiting, as they do most clearly, the principle of human increase, it
      is utterly impossible should have been the work of chance; on the
      contrary, the regularity with which the facts class themselves in
      conformity with that principle, and the striking analogy which the whole
      of them bear to each other, demonstrate equally the design of Nature, and
      the certainty of its accomplishment.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We are sorry to disturb Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s complacency. But, in our
      opinion, this table completely disproves his whole principle. If we read
      the columns perpendicularly, indeed, they seem to be in his favour. But
      how stands the case if we read horizontally? Does Mr. Sadler believe that,
      during the thirty years which elapsed between 1754 and 1784, the
      population of Prussia had been diminishing? No fact in history is better
      ascertained than that, during the long peace which followed the seven
      years&rsquo; war, it increased with great rapidity. Indeed, if the
      fecundity were what Mr. Sadler states it to have been, it must have
      increased with great <span class="pagenum">237</span><a name="link237"
      id="link237"></a>rapidity. Yet, the ratio of births to marriages is
      greater in 1784 than in 1754, and that in every province. It is,
      therefore, perfectly clear that the fecundity does not diminish whenever
      the density of the population increases.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will try another of Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s tables:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0006" id="linkimage-0006"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </div>

      <a href="images/0243.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Standing by itself, this table, like most of the others, seems to support
      Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s theory. But surely London, at the close of the
      seventeenth century, was far more thickly peopled than the kingdom of
      England now is. Yet the fecundity in London at the close of the
      seventeenth century was 4; and the average fecundity of the whole kingdom
      now is not more, according to Mr. Sadler, than 3.5 Then, again, the large
      towns in 1700 were far more thickly peopled than Westmorland and the North
      Riding of Yorkshire now are. Yet the fecundity in those large towns was
      then 4.5. And Mr. Sadler tells us that it is now only 4.2 in Westmorland
      and the North Riding.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is scarcely necessary to say any thing about the <span class="pagenum">238</span><a
      name="link238" id="link238"></a>censuses of the Netherlands, as Mr. Sadler
      himself confesses that there is some difficulty in reconciling them with
      his theory, and helps out his awkward explanation by supposing, quite
      gratuitously, as it seems to us, that the official documents are
      inaccurate. The armament which he has drawn from the United States will
      detain us but for a very short time. He has not told us,&mdash;perhaps he
      had not the means of telling us,&mdash;what proportion the number of
      births in the different parts of that country bears to the number of
      marriages. He shows that in the thinly-peopled states the number of
      children bears a greater proportion to the number of grown-up people than
      in the old states; and this, he conceives, is a sufficient proof that the
      condensation of the population is unfavourable to fecundity. We deny the
      inference altogether. Nothing can be more obvious than the explanation of
      the phenomenon. The back settlements are for the most part peopled by
      emigration from the old states; and emigrants are almost always breeders.
      They are almost always vigorous people in the prime of life. Mr. Sadler
      himself, in another part of his book, in which he tries very
      unsuccessfully to show that, the rapid multiplication of the people of
      America is principally owing to emigration from Europe, states this fact
      in the plainest manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Nothing is more certain, than that emigration is almost
      universally supplied by &lsquo;single persons in the beginning of mature
      life;&rsquo; nor, secondly, that such persons, as Dr. Franklin long ago
      asserted, &lsquo;marry and raise families.&rsquo; </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor is this all. It is not more true, that emigrants, generally
      speaking, consist of individuals in the prime of life&rsquo;, than that
      &lsquo;they are the most active and vigorous&rsquo; of that age, as Dr.
      Sey-bert describes them to be. They are, as it respects the principle at
      issue, a select class, even compared with that of their own age generally
      considered. Their very object in leaving their native <span class="pagenum">239</span><a
      name="link239" id="link239"></a>countries is to settle in life, a phrase
      that needs no explanation; and they do so. No equal number of human
      beings, therefore, have ever given so large or rapid an increase to a
      community as &lsquo;settlers&rsquo; have invariably done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is perfectly clear that children are more numerous in the back
      settlements of America than in the maritime states, not because unoccupied
      land makes people prolific, but because the most prolific people go to the
      unoccupied laud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sadler having, as he conceives, fully established his theory of
      population by statistical evidence, proceeds to prove, &ldquo;that it is
      in unison, or rather required by the principles of physiology.&rdquo; The
      difference between himself and his opponents he states as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>In pursuing this part of my subject, I must begin by reminding
      the reader of the difference between those who hold the superfecundity of
      mankind and myself, in regard to those principles which will form the
      basis of the present argument. They contend, that production precedes
      population; I, on the contrary, maintain that population precedes, and is
      indeed the cause of, production. They teach that man breeds up to the
      capital, or in proportion to the abundance of the food, he possesses; I
      assert, that he is comparatively sterile when he is wealthy, and that he
      breeds in proportion to his poverty; not meaning, however, by that
      poverty, a state of privation approaching to actual starvation, any more
      than, I suppose, they would contend, that extreme and culpable excess is
      the grand patron of population. In a word, they hold that a state of ease
      and affluence is the great promoter of prolificness: I maintain that a
      considerable degree of labour, and even privation, is a more efficient
      cause of an increased degree of human fecundity.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To prove this point he quotes Aristotle, Hippocrates, Dr. Short, Dr.
      Gregory, Dr. Perceval, M. Villermi, Lord Bacon, and Rousseau. We will not
      dispute about it; for it seems quite clear to us that if he succeeds <span
      class="pagenum">240</span><a name="link240" id="link240"></a>in
      establishing it he overturns his own theory. If men breed in proportion to
      their poverty, as he tells us here,&mdash;and at the same time breed in
      inverse proportion to their numbers, as he told us before,&mdash;it
      necessarily follows that the poverty of men must be in inverse proportion
      to their numbers. Inverse proportion, indeed, as we have shown, is not the
      phrase which expresses Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s meaning. To speak more
      correctly, it follows, from his own positions, that, if one population be
      thinner than another, it will also be poorer. Is this the fact? Mr. Sadler
      tells us, in one of those tables which we have already quoted, that in the
      United States the population is four to a square mile, and the fecundity
      5,22 to a marriage, and that in Russia the population is twenty-three to a
      square mile, and the fecundity 4.94 to a marriage. Is the North American
      labourer poorer than the Russian boor? If not, what becomes of Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s
      argument?
    </p>
    <p>
      The most decisive proof of Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s theory, according to him, is
      that which he has kept for the last. It is derived from the registers of
      the English Peerage. The Peers, he says, and says truly, are the class
      with respect to whom we possess the most accurate statistical information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Touching their number, this has been accurately known and
      recorded ever since the order has existed in the country. For several
      centuries past, the addition to it of a single individual has been a
      matter of public interest and notoriety: this hereditary honour conferring
      not personal dignity merely, but important privileges, and being almost
      always identified with great wealth and influence. The records relating to
      it are kept with the most scrupulous attention, not only by heirs and
      expectants, but they are appealed to by more distant connections, as
      conferring distinction on all who can claim such affinity. Hence there are
      few disputes concerning successions to this rank, but such as go back
      <span class="pagenum">241</span><a name="link241" id="link241"></a>to very
      remote periods. In later times, the marriages, births, and deaths, of the
      nobility, have not only been registered by and known to those personally
      interested, but have been published periodically, and, consequently,
      subject to perpetual correction and revision; while many of the most
      powerful motives which can influence the human mind conspire to preserve
      these records from the slightest falsification. Compared with these,
      therefore, all other registers, or reports, whether of sworn searchers or
      others, are incorrectness itself</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sadler goes on to tell us that the Peers are a marrying class, and
      that their general longevity proves them to be a healthy class. Still
      peerages often become extinct;&mdash;and from this fact he infers that
      they are a sterile class. So far, says he, from increasing in geometrical
      progression, they do not even keep up their numbers. &ldquo;Nature
      interdicts their increase.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Thus,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;in all ages of the world, and in
      every nation of it, have the highest ranks of the community been the most
      sterile, and the lowest the most prolific. As it respects our own country,
      from the lowest grade of society, the Irish peasant, to the highest, the
      British peer, this remains a conspicuous truth; and the regulation of the
      degree of fecundity conformably to this principle, through the
      intermediate gradations of society, constitutes one of the features of the
      system developed in these pages.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We take the issue which Mr. Sadler has himself offered. W agree with him,
      that the registers of the English Peerage are of far higher authority than
      any other statistical documents. We are content that by those registers
      his principles should be judged. And we meet him by positively denying his
      facts. We assert that the English nobles are not only not a sterile, but
      an eminently prolific, part of the community. Mr. Sadler concludes that
      they are sterile, merely because peerages often become extinct. Is this
      the proper way of ascertaining the point? Is it thus that he avails <span
      class="pagenum">242</span><a name="link242" id="link242"></a>himself of
      those registers on the accuracy and fulness of which he descants so
      largely? Surely his right course would have been to count the marriages,
      and the number of births in the Peerage. This he has not done;&mdash;but
      we have done it. And what is the result?
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears from the last edition of Debrett&rsquo;s <i>Peerage</i>,
      published in 1828, that there were at that time 287 peers of the United
      Kingdom, who had been married once or oftener. The whole number of
      marriages contracted by these 287 peers was 388. The number of children by
      these marriages was 1437,&mdash;more than five to a peer,&mdash;more than
      4.3 to a marriage,&mdash;more, that is to sav, than the average number in
      those counties of England in which, according to Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s own
      statement, the fecundity is the greatest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is not all. These marriages had not, in 1828, produced their full
      effect. Some of them had been very lately contracted. In a very large
      proportion of them there was every probability of additional issue. To
      allow for this probability, we may safely add one to the average which we
      have already obtained, and rate the fecundity of a noble marriage in
      England at 5.3;&mdash;higher than the fecundity which Mr. Sadler assigns
      to the people of the United States. Even if we do not make this allowance,
      the average fecundity of the marriages of peers is higher by one-fifth
      than the average fecundity of marriages throughout the kingdom. And this
      is the sterile class! This is the class which &ldquo;nature has
      interdicted from increasing!&rdquo; The evidence to which Mr. Sadler has
      himself appealed proves that his principle is false,&mdash;utterly false,&mdash;wildly
      and extravagantly false. It proves that a class. <span class="pagenum">243</span><a
      name="link243" id="link243"></a>living during half of every year in the
      most crowded population in the world, breeds faster than those who live in
      the country;&mdash;that the class which enjoys the greatest degree of
      luxury and ease breeds faster than the class which undergoes labour and
      privation. To talk a little in Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s style, we must own that
      we are ourselves surprised at the results which our examination of the
      peerage has brought out. We certainly should have thought that the habits
      of fashionable life, and long residence even in the most airy parts of so
      great a city as London, would have been more unfavourable to the fecundity
      of the higher orders than they appear to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peerages, it is true, often become extinct. But it is quite clear, from
      what we have stated, that this is not because peeresses are barren. There
      is no difficulty in discovering what the causes really are. In the first
      place, most of the titles of our nobles are limited to heirs male; so
      that, though the average fecundity of a noble marriage is upwards of five,
      yet, for the purpose of keeping up a peerage, it cannot be reckoned at
      much more than two and a half. Secondly, though the peers are, as Mr.
      Sadler says, a marrying class, the younger sons of peers are decidedly not
      a marrying class; so that a peer, though he has at least as great a chance
      of having a son as his neighbours, has less chance than they of having a
      collateral heir.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have now disposed, we think, of Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s principle of
      population. Our readers must, by this time, be pretty well satisfied as to
      his qualifications for setting up theories of his own. We will, therefore,
      present them with a few instances of the skill and fairness which he shows
      when he undertakes to null down the theories of other men. The doctrine
      <span class="pagenum">244</span><a name="link244" id="link244"></a>of Mr.
      Malthus, that population, if not checked by want, by vice, by excessive
      mortality, or by the prudent self-denial of individuals, would increase in
      a geometric progression, is, in Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s opinion, at once false
      and atrocious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may at once be denied,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that human
      increase proceeds geometrically; and for this simple but decisive reason,
      that the existence of a geometrical ratio of increase in the works of
      nature, is neither true nor possible. It would fling into utter confusion
      all order, time, magnitude, and space.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This is as curious a specimen of reasoning as any that has been offered to
      the world since the days when theories were founded on the principle that
      nature abhors a vacuum. We proceed a few pages farther, however; and we
      then find that geometric progression is unnatural only in those cases in
      which Mr. Malthus conceives that it exists; and that, in all cases in
      which Mr. Malthus denies the existence of a geometric ratio, nature
      changes sides, and adopts that ratio as the rule of increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Malthus holds that subsistence will increase only in an arithmetical
      ratio. &ldquo;As far as nature has to do with the question,&rdquo; says
      Mr. Sadler, &ldquo;men might, for instance, plant twice the number of
      peas, and breed from a double number of the same animals, with equal
      prospect of their multiplication.&rdquo; Now, if Mr. Sadler thinks that,
      as far as nature is concerned, four sheep will double as fast as two, and
      eight as fast as four, how can he deny that the geometrical ratio of
      increase does exist in the works of nature? Or has he a definition of his
      own for geometrical progression, as well as for inverse proportion?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Malthus, and those who agree with him, have <span class="pagenum">245</span><a
      name="link245" id="link245"></a>generally referred to the United States,
      as a country in which the human race increases in a &lsquo;geometrical
      ratio, and have fixed on twenty-five years as the term in which the
      population of that country doubles itself. Mr. Sadler contends that it is
      physically impossible for a people to double in twenty-five years; nay,
      that thirty-five years is far too short a period,&mdash;that the Americans
      do not double by procreation in less than forty-seven years,&mdash;and
      that the rapid increase of their numbers is produced by emigration from
      Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emigration has certainly had some effect in increasing the population of
      the United States. But so great has the rate of that increase been that,
      after making frill allowance for the effect of emigration, there win be a
      residue, attributable to procreation alone, amply sufficient to double the
      population in twenty-five years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sadler states the results of the four censuses as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>There were, of white inhabitants, in the whole of the United
      States in 1790, 3,093,111; in 1800, 4,309,656; in 1810, 5,862,093; and in
      1820, 7,861,710. The increase, in the first term, being 39 per cent.; that
      in the second, 36 per cent.; and that in the third and last, 33 per cent.
      It is superfluous to say, that it is utterly impossible to deduce the
      geometric theory of human increase, whatever be the period of duplication,
      from such terms as these.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sadler is a bad arithmetician. The increase in the last term is not,
      as he states it, 33 per cent., but more than 34 per cent. Now, an increase
      of 32 per cent, in ten years, is more than sufficient to double the
      population in twenty-five years. And there is, we think, very strong
      reason to believe that the white population of the United States does
      increase by 32 per cent, every ten years. <span class="pagenum">246</span><a
      name="link246" id="link246"></a>Our reason is this. There is in the United
      States a class of persons whose numbers are not increased by emigration,&mdash;the
      negro slaves. During the interval which elapsed between the census of 1810
      and the census of 1820, the change in their numbers must have been
      produced by procreation, and by procreation alone. Their situation, though
      much happier than that of the wretched beings who cultivate the sugar
      plantations of Trinidad and Demerara, cannot be supposed to be more
      favourable to health and fecundity than that of free labourers. In 1810,
      the slave trade had been but recently abolished; and there were in
      consequence many more male than female slaves,&mdash;a circumstance, of
      course, very unfavourable to procreation. Slaves are perpetually passing
      into the class of freemen; but no freeman ever descends into servitude; so
      that the census will not exhibit the whole effect of the procreation which
      really takes place.
    </p>
    <p>
      We find, by the census of 1810, that the number of slaves in the Union was
      then 1,191,000. In 1820, they had increased to 1,538,000. That is to say,
      in ten years, they had increased 29 per cent.&mdash;within three per cent
      of that rate of increase which would double their numbers in twenty-five
      years. We may, we think, fairly calculate that, if the female slaves had
      been as numerous as the males, and if no manumissions had taken place, the
      census of the slave population would have exhibited an increase of 32 per
      cent, in ten years.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we are right in fixing on 32 per cent, as the rate at which the white
      population of America increases by procreation in ten years, it will
      follow that, during the last ten years of the eighteenth century, nearly
      one-sixth of the increase was the effect of emigration; from <span
      class="pagenum">247</span><a name="link247" id="link247"></a>1800 to 1810,
      about one-ninth; and from 1810 to 1820, about one-seventeenth. This is
      what we should have expected; for it is clear that, unless the number of
      emigrants be constantly increasing, it must, as compared with the resident
      population, be relatively decreasing. The number of persons added to the
      population of the United States by emigration, between 1810 and 1820,
      would be nearly 120,000. From the data furnished by Mr. Sadler himself, we
      should be inclined to think that this would be a fair estimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dr. Seybert says, that the passengers to ten of the principal
      ports of the United States, in the year 1817, amounted to 22,235; of whom
      11,977 were from Great Britain and Ireland; 4,164 from Germany and
      Holland: 1,245 from France; 58 from Italy; 2,901 from the British
      possessions in North America; 1,569 from the West Indies; and from all
      other countries, 321. These, however, we may conclude, with the editor of
      Styles&rsquo;s Register, were far short of the number that arrived</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We have not the honour of knowing either Dr. Seybert or the editor of
      Styles&rsquo;s Register. We cannot, therefore, decide on their respective
      claims to our confidence so peremptorily as Mr. Sadler thinks fit to do.
      Nor can we agree to what Mr. Sadler very gravely assigns as a reason for
      disbelieving Dr. Seybert&rsquo;s testimony. &ldquo;Such accounts,&rdquo;
      he says, &ldquo;if not wilfully exaggerated, must always fall short of the
      truth.&rdquo; It would be a curious question of casuistry to determine
      what a man ought to do in a case in which he cannot tell the truth except
      by being guilty of wilful exaggeration. We will, however, suppose, with
      Mr. Sadler, that Dr. Seybert, finding himself compelled to choose between
      two sins, preferred telling a falsehood to exaggerating; and that he has
      consequently underrated the number of emigrants. We will take it at double
      of the <span class="pagenum">248</span><a name="link248" id="link248"></a>Doctor&rsquo;s
      estimate, and suppose that, in 1817, 45,000 Europeans crossed to the
      United States. Now, it must be remembered that the year 1817 was a year of
      the severest and most general distress over all Europe,&mdash;a year of
      scarcity everywhere, and of cruel famine in some places. There can,
      therefore, be no doubt that the emigration of 1817 was very far above the
      average, probably more than three times that of an ordinary year. Till the
      year 1815, the war rendered it almost impossible to emigrate to the United
      States either from England or from the Continent. If we suppose the
      average emigration of the remaining years to have been 16,000, we shall
      probably not be much mistaken. In 1818 and 1819, the number was certainly
      much beyond that average; in 1815 and 1816, probably much below it. But,
      even if we were to suppose that, in every year from the peace to 1820, the
      number of emigrants had been as high as we have supposed it to be in 1817,
      the increase by procreation among the white inhabitants of the United
      States would still appear to be about 30 per cent, in ten years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sadler acknowledges that Cobbett exaggerates the number of emigrants
      when he states it at 150,000 a year. Yet even this estimate, absurdly
      great as it is, would not be sufficient to explain the increase of the
      population of the United States on Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s principles. He is,
      he tells us, &ldquo;convinced that doubling in 35 years is a far more
      rapid duplication than ever has taken place in that country from
      procreation only.&rdquo; An increase of 20 per cent, in ten years, by
      procreation, would therefore be the very utmost that he would allow to be
      possible. We have already shown, by reference to the census of the slave
      population, that this doctrine is quite absurd. And, if we suppose it to
      <span class="pagenum">249</span><a name="link249" id="link249"></a>be
      sound, we shall be driven to the conclusion that above eight hundred
      thousand people emigrated from Europe to the United States in a space of
      little more than five years. The whole increase of the white population
      from 1810 to 1820 was within a few hundreds of 2,000,000. If we are to
      attribute to procreation only 20 per cent, on the number returned by the
      census of 1810, we shall have about 830,000 persons to account for in some
      other way;&mdash;and to suppose that the emigrants who went to America
      between the peace of 1815 and the census of 1820, with the children who
      were born to them there, would make up that number, would be the height of
      absurdity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could say much more; but we think it quite unnecessary at present. We
      have shown that Mr. Sadler is careless in the collection of facts,&mdash;that
      he is incapable of reasoning on facts when he has collected them,&mdash;that
      he does not understand the simplest terms of science,&mdash;that he has
      enounced a proposition of which he does not know the meaning,&mdash;that
      the proposition which he means to enounce, and which he tries to prove,
      leads directly to all those consequences which he represents as impious
      and immoral,&mdash;and that, from the very documents to which he has
      himself appealed, it may be demonstrated that his theory is false. We may,
      perhaps, resume the subject when his next volume appears. Meanwhile, we
      hope that he will delay its publication until he has learned a little
      arithmetic, and unlearned a great deal of eloquence.

      eminently beautiful and splendid edition of a book which well deserves all
      that the printer and the engraver can do for it. The Life of Bunyan is, of
      course, not a performance which can add much to the literary reputation of
      such a writer as Mr. Southey. But it is written in excellent English, and,
      for the most part, in an excellent spirit. Mr. Southey propounds, we need
      not say, many opinions from which we altogether dissent; and his attempts
      to excuse the odious persecution to which Bunyan was subjected have
      sometimes moved our indignation. But we will avoid this topic. We are at
      present much more inclined to join in paying homage to the genius of a
      great man than to engage in a controversy concerning church-government and
      toleration.

      We must not pass without notice the engravings with which this volume is
      decorated. Some of Mr. Heath&rsquo;s wood-cuts are admirably designed and
      executed. Mr. Martin&rsquo;s illustrations do not please us quite so well.
      His Valley of the Shadow of Death is not that Valley of the Shadow of
      Death which Bunyan imagined. At all events, it is not that dark and

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">251</span><a name="link251" id="link251"></a>horrible
      glen which has from childhood been in our mind&rsquo;s eye. The valley is
      a cavern: the quagmire is a lake: the straight path runs zigzag: and
      Christian appears like a speck in the darkness of the immense vault. We
      miss, too, those hideous forms which make so striking a part of the
      description of Bunyan, and which Salvator Rosa would have loved to draw.
      It is with unfeigned diffidence that we pronounce judgment on any question
      relating to the art of painting. But it appears to us that Mr. Martin has
      not of late been fortunate in his choice of subjects. He should never have
      attempted to illustrate the Paradise Lost. There can be no two manners
      more directly opposed to each other than the manner of his painting and
      the manner of Milton&rsquo;s poetry. Those things which are mere
      accessories in the description! become the principal objects in the
      pictures; and those figures which are most prominent in the descriptions
      can be detected in the pictures only by a very close scrutiny. Mr. Martin
      has succeeded perfectly in representing the pillars and candelabra of
      Pand√¶imonium. But he has forgotten that Milton&rsquo;s Pand√¶monium is
      merely the background to Satan. In the picture, the Archangel is scarcely
      visible amidst the endless colonnades of his infernal palace. Milton&rsquo;s
      Paradise, again, is merely the background to his Adam and Eve. But in Mr.
      Martin&rsquo;s picture! the landscape is everything. Adam, Eve, and
      Raphael attract much less notice than the lake and the mountains, the
      gigantic flowers, and the giraffes which feed upon them. We read that
      James the Second sat to Varelst, the great flower-painter. When the
      performance was finished, his Majesty appeared in the midst of a bower of
      sun-flowers and tulips, which completely drew away all attention from the
      central figure. <span class="pagenum">252</span><a name="link252"
      id="link252"></a>All who looked at the portrait took it for a
      flower-piece. Mr. Martin, we think, introduces his immeasurable spaces,
      his innumerable multitudes, his gorgeous prodigies of architecture and
      landscape, almost as unseasonably as Varelst introduced his flower-pots
      and nosegays. If Mr. Martin were to paint Lear in the storm, we suspect
      that the blazing sky, the sheets of rain, the swollen torrents, and the
      tossing forest, would draw away all attention from the agonies of the
      insulted king and father. If he were to paint the death of Lear, the old
      man, asking the by-standers to undo his button, would be thrown into the
      shade by a vast blaze of pavilions, standards, armour, and heralds&rsquo;
      coats. Mr. Martin would illustrate the Orlando Furioso well, the Orlando
      Innamorato still better, the Arabian Nights best of all. Fairy palaces and
      gardens, porticoes of agate, and groves flowering with emeralds and
      rubies, inhabited by people for whom nobody cares, these are his proper
      domain. He would succeed admirably in the enchanted ground of Alcina, or
      the mansion of Aladdin. But he should avoid Milton and Bunyan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The characteristic peculiarity of the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress is that it
      is the only work of its kind which possesses a strong human interest.
      Other allegories only amuse the fancy. The allegory of Bunyan has been
      read by many thousands with tears. There are some good allegories in
      Johnson&rsquo;s works, and some of still higher merit by Addison. In these
      performances there is, perhaps, as much wit and ingenuity as in the
      Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress. But the pleasure which is produced by the Vision
      of Mirza, the Vision of Theodore, the genealogy of Wit, or the contest
      between Rest and Labour, is exactly similar to the pleasure which we
      derive <span class="pagenum">253</span><a name="link253" id="link253"></a>from
      one of Cowley&rsquo;s odes or from a canto of Hudibras. It is a pleasure
      which belongs wholly to the understanding, and in which the feelings have
      no part whatever. Nay, even Spenser himself, though assuredly one of the
      greatest poets that ever lived, could not succeed in the attempt to make
      allegory interesting. It was in vain that he lavished the riches of his
      mind on the House of Pride and the House of Temperance. One unpardonable
      fault, the fault of tediousness, pervades the whole of the Fairy Queen. We
      become sick of cardinal virtues and deadly sins, and long for the society
      of plain men and women. Of the persons who read the first canto, not one
      in ten reaches the end of the first book, and not one in a hundred
      perseveres to the end of the poem. Very few and very weary are those who
      are in at the death of the Blatant Beast. If the last six books, which are
      said to have been destroyed in Ireland, had been preserved. We doubt
      whether any heart less stout than that of a commentator would have held
      out to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not so with the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress. That wonderful book, while
      it obtains admiration from the most fastidious critics, is loved by those
      who are too simple to admire it. Dr. Johnson, all whose studies were
      desultory, and who hated, as he said, to read books through, made an
      exception in favour of the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress. That work was one of
      the two or three works which he wished longer. It was by no common merit
      that the illiterate sectary extracted praise like this from the most
      pedantic of critics and the most bigoted of Tories. In the wildest parts
      of Scotland the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress is the delight of the peasantry:
      In every nursery the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress is a greater favourite than
      Jack the Giant-killer. Every reader knows the <span class="pagenum">254</span><a
      name="link254" id="link254"></a>straight and narrow path as well as he
      knows a road in which he has gone backward and forward a hundred times.
      This is the highest miracle of genius, that things which are not should he
      as though they were, that the imaginations of one mind should become the
      personal recollections of another. And this miracle the tinker has
      wrought. There is no ascent, no declivity, no resting-place, no
      turn-stile, with which we are net perfectly acquainted. The wicket gate,
      and the desolate swamp which separates it from the City of Destruction,
      the long line of road, as straight as a rule can make it, the Interpreter&rsquo;s
      house and all its fair shows, the prisoner in the iron cage, the palace,
      at the doors of which armed men kept guard, and on the battlements of
      which walked persons clothed all in gold, the cross and the sepulchre, the
      steep hill and the pleasant arbour, the stately front of the House
      Beautiful by the wayside, the chained lions crouching in the porch, the
      low green valley of Humiliation, rich with grass and covered with flocks,
      all are as well known to us as the sights of our own street. Then we come
      to the narrow place where Apollyon strode right across the whole breadth
      of the way, to stop the journey of Christian, and where afterwards the
      pillar was set up to testify how bravely the pilgrim had fought the good
      fight. As we advance, the valley becomes deeper and deeper. The shade of
      the precipices on both sides falls blacker and blacker. The clouds gather
      overhead. Doleful voices, the clanking of chains, and the rushing of many
      feet to and fro, are heard through the darkness. The way, hardly
      discernible in gloom, runs close by the mouth of the burning pit, which
      sends forth its flames, its noisome smoke, and its hideous shapes, to
      terrify the adventurer. Thence he goes on, <span class="pagenum">255</span><a
      name="link255" id="link255"></a>amidst the snares and pitfalls, with the
      mangled bodies of those who have perished lying in the ditch by his side.
      At the end of the long dark valley he passes the dens in which the old
      giants dwelt, amidst the bones of those whom they had slain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the road passes straight on through a waste moor, till at length the
      towers of a distant city appear before the traveller; and soon he is in
      the midst of the innumerable multitudes of Vanity Fair. There are the
      jugglers and the apes, the shops and the puppet-shows. There are Italian
      Row, and French Row, and Spanish Row, and Britain Row, with their crowds
      of buyers, sellers, and loungers, jabbering all the languages of the
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thence we go on by the little hill of the silver mine, and through the
      meadow of lilies, along the bank of that pleasant river which is bordered
      on both sides by fruit-trees. On the left branches off the path leading to
      the horrible castle, the court-yard of which is paved with the skulls of
      pilgrims; and right onward are the sheepfolds and orchards of the
      Delectable Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Delectable Mountains, the way lies through the fogs and briers of
      the Enchanted Ground, with here and there a bed of soft cushions spread
      under a green arbour. And beyond is the land of Beulah, where the flowers,
      the grapes, and the songs of birds never cease, and where the sun shines
      night and day. Thence are plainly seen the golden pavements and streets of
      pearl, on the other side of that black and cold river over which there is
      no bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the stages of the journey, all the forms which cross or overtake the
      pilgrims, giants, and hobgoblins, ill-favoured ones, and shining ones, the
      tall, comely, swarthy Madame Bubble, with her great purse by her side,
      <span class="pagenum">256</span><a name="link256" id="link256"></a>and her
      fingers playing with the money, the black man in the bright vesture, Mr.
      Worldly Wiseman and my Lord Hategood, Mr. Talkative, and Mrs. Timorous,
      all are actually existing beings to us. We follow the travellers through
      their allegorical progress with interest not inferior to that with which
      we follow Elizabeth from Siberia to Moscow, or Jeanie Deans from Edinburgh
      to London. Bunyan is almost the only writer who ever gave to the abstract
      the interest of the concrete. In the works of many celebrated authors, men
      are mere personifications. We have not a jealous man, but jealousy; not a
      traitor, but perfidy; not a patriot, but patriotism. The mind of Bunyan,
      on the contrary, was so imaginative that personifications, when he dealt
      with them, became men. A dialogue between two qualities, in his dream, has
      more dramatic effect than a dialogue between two human beings in most
      plays. In this respect the genius of Bunyan bore a great resemblance to
      that of a man who had very little else in common with him, Percy Bysshe
      Shelley. The strong imagination of Shelley made him an idolater in his own
      despite. Out of the most indefinite terms of a hard, cold, dark,
      metaphysical system, he made a gorgeous Pantheon, full of beautiful,
      majestic, and lifelike forms. He turned atheism itself into a mythology,
      rich with visions as glorious as the gods that live in the marble of
      Phidias, or the virgin saints that smile on us from the canvass of
      Murillo. The Spirit of Beauty, the Principle of Good, the Principle of
      Evil, when he treated of them, ceased to be abstractions. They took shape
      and colour. They were no longer mere words; but &ldquo;intelligible forms;&rdquo;
      &ldquo;fair humanities;&rdquo; objects of love, of adoration, or of fear.
      As there can be no stronger sign of a mind destitute of <span
      class="pagenum">257</span><a name="link257" id="link257"></a>the poetical
      faculty than that tendency which was so common among the writers of the
      French school to turn images Into abstractions, Venus, for example, into
      Love, Minerva into Wisdom, Mars into War, and Bacchus into Festivity, so
      there can be no stronger sign of a mind truly poetical than a disposition
      to reverse this abstracting process, and to make individuals out of
      generalities. Some of the metaphysical and ethical theories of Shelley
      were certainly most absurd and pernicious. But we doubt whether any modern
      poet has possessed in an equal degree some of the highest qualities of the
      great ancient masters. The words bard and inspiration, which seem so cold
      and affected when applied to other modern writers, have a perfect
      propriety when applied to him. He was not an author, but a bard. His
      poetry seems not to have been an art, but an inspiration. Had he lived to
      the full age of man, he might not improbably have given to the world some
      great work of the very highest rank in design and execution. But, alas!

    <p>
      But we must return to Bunyan. The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress undoubtedly is
      not a perfect allegory. The types are often inconsistent with each other;
      and sometimes the allegorical disguise is altogether thrown off. The
      river, for example, is emblematic of death; and we are told that every
      human being must pass through the river. But Faithful does not pass
      through it. He is martyred, not in shadow, but in reality, at Vanity Fair
      Hopeful talks to Christian about Esau&rsquo;s birthright and about his own
      convictions of sin as Bunyan might have talked with one of his own
      congregation. The damsels at the House Beautiful catechize Christiana&rsquo;s
      <span class="pagenum">258</span><a name="link258" id="link258"></a>boys,
      as any good ladies might catechize any boys at a Sunday School. But we do
      not believe that any man, whatever might be his genius, and whatever his
      good luck, could long continue a figurative history without falling into
      many inconsistencies. We are sure that inconsistencies, scarcely less
      gross than the worst into which Bunyan has fallen, may be found in the
      shortest and most elaborate allegories of the Spectator and the Rambler.
      The Tale of a Tub and the History of John Bull swarm with similar errors,
      if the name of error can be properly applied to that which is unavoidable.
      It is not easy to make a simile go on all-fours. But we believe that no
      human ingenuity could produce such a centipede as a long allegory in which
      the correspondence between the outward sign and the thing signified should
      be exactly preserved. Certainly no writer, ancient or modern, has yet
      achieved the adventure. The best thing, on the whole, that an allego-rist
      can do, is to present to his readers a succession of analogies, each of
      which may separately be striking and happy, without looking very nicely to
      see whether they harmonize with each other. This Bunyan has done; and,
      though a minute scrutiny may detect inconsistencies in every page of his
      Tale, the general effect which the Tale produces on all persons, learned
      and unlearned, proves that he has done well. The passages which it is most
      difficult to defend are those in which he altogether drops the allegory,
      and puts into the mouth of his pilgrims religious ejaculations and
      disquisitions, better suited to his own pulpit at Bedford or Reading than
      to the Enchanted Ground or to the Interpreter&rsquo;s Garden. Yet even
      these passages, though we will not undertake to defend them against the
      objections of critics, we feel that we could ill spare. We <span
      class="pagenum">259</span><a name="link259" id="link259"></a>feel that the
      story owes much of its charm to these occasional glimpses of solemn and
      effecting subjects, which will not be hidden, which force themselves
      through the veil, and appear before us in their native aspect. The effect
      is not unlike that which is said to have been produced on the ancient
      stage, when the eyes of the actor were seen flaming through his mask, and
      giving life and expression to what would else have been an inanimate and
      uninteresting disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very amusing and very instructive to compare the Pilgrim&rsquo;s
      Progress with the Grace Abounding. The latter work is indeed one of the
      most remarkable pieces of autobiography in the world. It is a full and
      open confession of the fancies which passed through the mind of an
      illiterate man, whose affections were warm, whose nerves were irritable,
      whose imagination was ungovernable, and who was under the influence of the
      strongest religious excitement. In whatever age Bunyan had lived, the
      history of his feelings would, in all probability, have been very curious.
      But the time in which his lot was cast was the time of a great stirring of
      the human mind. A tremendous burst of public feeling, produced by the
      tyranny of the hierarchy, menaced the old ecclesiastical institutions with
      destruction. To the gloomy regularity of one intolerant Church had
      succeeded the license of innumerable sects, drunk with the sweet and heady
      must of their new liberty. Fanaticism, engendered by persecution, and
      destined to engender persecution in turn, spread rapidly through society.
      Even the strongest and most commanding minds were not proof against this
      strange taint. Any time might have produced George Fox and James Naylor.
      But to one time alone belong the frantic delusions of such a statesman
      <span class="pagenum">260</span><a name="link260" id="link260"></a>as
      Vane, and the hysterical tears of such a soldier as Cromwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of Bunyan is the history of a most excitable mind in an age of
      excitement. By most of his biographers he has been treated with gross
      injustice. They have understood in a popular sense all those strong terms
      of self-condemnation which he employed in a theological sense. They have,
      therefore, represented him as an abandoned wretch reclaimed by means
      almost miraculous, or, to use their favourite metaphor, &ldquo;as a brand
      plucked from the burning.&rdquo; Mr. Ivimey calls him the depraved Bunyan
      and the wicked tinker of Elstow. Surely Mr. Ivimey ought to have been too
      familiar with the bitter accusations which the most pious people are in
      the habit, of bringing against themselves, to understand literally all the
      strong expressions which are to be found in the Grace Abounding. It is
      quite clear, as Mr. Southey most justly remarks, that Bunyan never was a
      vicious man. He married very early; and he solemnly declares that he was
      strictly faithful to his wife. He does not appear to have been a drunkard.
      He owns, indeed, that, when a boy, he never spoke without an oath. But a
      single admonition cured him of this bad habit for life; and the cure must
      have been wrought early; for at eighteen he was in the army of the
      Parliament; and, if he had carried the vice of profaneness into that
      service, he would doubtless have received something more than an
      admonition from Serjeant Bind-their-kings-in-chains, or Captain
      Hew-Agag-in-pieces-before-the-Lord. Bell-ringing and playing at hockey on
      Sundays seem to have been the worst vices of this depraved tinker. They
      would have passed for virtues with Archbishop Laud. It is quite clear
      that, from a very early age, Bunyan was a man of a <span class="pagenum">261</span><a
      name="link261" id="link261"></a>strict life and of a tender conscience.
      &ldquo;He had been,&rdquo; says Mr. Southey, &ldquo;a blackguard.&rdquo;
      Even this we think too hard a censure. Bunyan was not, we admit, so fine a
      gentleman as Lord Digby; but he was a blackguard no otherwise than as
      every labouring man that ever lived has been a blackguard. Indeed Mr.
      Southey acknowledges this. &ldquo;Such he might have been expected to be
      by his birth, breeding, and vocation. Scarcely indeed, by possibility,
      could he have been otherwise.&rdquo; A man whose manners and sentiments
      are decidedly below those of his class deserves to be called a blackguard.
      But it is surely unfair to apply so strong a word of reproach to one who
      is only what the great mass of every community must inevitably be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those horrible internal conflicts which Bunyan has described with so much
      power of language prove, not that he was a worse man than his neighbours,
      but that his mind was constantly occupied by religious considerations,
      that his fervour exceeded his knowledge, and that his imagination
      exercised despotic power over his body and mind. He heard voices from
      heaven. He saw strange visions of distant hills, pleasant and sunny as his
      own Delectable Mountains. From those abodes he was shut out, and placed in
      a dark and horrible wilderness, where he wandered through ice and snow,
      striving to make his way into the happy region of light. At one time he
      was seized with an inclination to work miracles. At another time he
      thought himself actually possessed by the devil. He could distinguish the
      blasphemous whispers. He felt his infernal enemy pulling at his clothes
      behind him. He spurned with his feet and struck with his hands at the
      destroyer. Sometimes he was tempted to sell his part in the salvation
      <span class="pagenum">262</span><a name="link262" id="link262"></a>of
      mankind. Sometimes a violent impulse urged him to start up from his food,
      to fall on his knees, and to break forth into prayer. At length he fancied
      that he had committed the unpardonable sin. His agony convulsed his robust
      frame. He was, he says, as if his breastbone would split; and this he took
      for a sign that he was destined to burst asunder like Judas. The agitation
      of his nerves made all his movements tremulous; and this trembling, he
      supposed, was a visible mark of his reprobation, like that which had been
      set on Cain. At one time, indeed, an encouraging voice seemed to rush in
      at the window, like the noise of wind, but very pleasant, and commanded,
      as he says, a great calm in his soul. At another time, a word of comfort
      &ldquo;was spoke loud unto him; it showed a great word; it seemed to be
      writ in great letters.&rdquo; But these intervals of ease were short: His
      state, during two years and a half, was generally the most horrible that
      the human mind can imagine. &ldquo;I walked,&rdquo; says he, with his own
      peculiar eloquence, &ldquo;to a neighbouring town; and sat down upon a
      settle in the street, and fell into a very deep pause about the most
      fearful state my sin had brought me to; and, after long musing, I lifted
      up my head; but methought I saw as if the sun that shineth in the heavens
      did grudge to give me light; and as if the very stones in the street, and
      tiles upon the houses, did band themselves against me. Methought that they
      all combined together to banish me out of the world. I was abhorred of
      them, and unfit to dwell among them, because I had sinned against the
      Saviour. Oh, how happy now was every creature over I! for they stood fast,
      and kept their station. But I was gone and lost.&rdquo; Scarcely any
      madhouse could produce an instance of delusion so strong, or of misery so
      acute. <span class="pagenum">263</span><a name="link263" id="link263"></a>It
      was through this Valley of the Shadow of Death, overhung by darkness,
      peopled with devils, resounding with blasphemy and lamentation, and
      passing amidst quagmires, snares, and pitfalls, close by the very mouth of
      hell, that Bunyan journeyed to that bright and fruitful land of Beulah, in
      which he sojourned during the latter period of his pilgrimage. The only
      trace which his cruel sufferings and temptations seem to have left behind
      them was an affectionate compassion for those who were still in the state
      in which he had once been. Religion has scarcely ever worn a form so calm
      and soothing as in his allegory. The feeling which predominates through
      the whole book is a feeling of tenderness for weak, timid, and harassed
      minds. The character of Mr. Fearing, of Mr. Feeble-Mind, of Mr.
      Despondency and his daughter Miss Muchafraid, the account of poor
      Littlefaith who was robbed by the three thieves, of his spending money,
      the description of Christian&rsquo;s terror in the dungeons of Giant
      Despair and in his passage through the river, all clearly show how strong
      a sympathy Runyan felt, after his own mind had become clear and cheerful,
      for persons afflicted with religious melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Southey, who has no love for the Calvinists, admits that, if Calvinism
      had never worn a blacker appearance than in Bunyan&rsquo;s works, it would
      never have become a term of reproach. In fact, those works of Bunyan with
      which we are acquainted are by no means more Calvinistic than the articles
      and homilies of the Church of England. The moderation of his opinions on
      the subject of predestination gave offence to some zealous persons. We
      have seen an absurd allegory, the heroine of which is named Hephzibah,
      written by some raving supralapsarian preacher <span class="pagenum">264</span><a
      name="link264" id="link264"></a>who was dissatisfied with the mild
      theology of the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress. In this foolish hook, if we
      recollect rightly, the Interpreter is called the Enlightener, and the
      House Beautiful is Castle Strength. Mr. Southey tells us that the
      Catholics had also their Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress, without a Giant Pope,
      in which the Interpeter is the Director, and the House Beautiful Grace&rsquo;s
      Hall. It is surely a remarkable proof of the power of Bunyan&rsquo;s
      genius, that two religious parties, both of which regarded his opinions as
      heterodox, should have had recourse to him for assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are, we think, some characters and scenes in the Pilgrim&rsquo;s
      Progress, which can be fully comprehended and enjoyed only by persons
      familiar with the history of the times through which Bunyan lived. The
      character of Mr. Greatheart, the guide, is an example. His fighting is, of
      course, allegorical; but the allegory is not strictly preserved. He
      delivers a sermon on imputed righteousness to his companions; and, soon
      after, he gives battle to Giant Grim, who had taken upon him to back the
      lions. He expounds the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah to the household and
      guests of Gaius; and then he sallies out to attack Slaygood, who was of
      the nature of flesh-eaters, in his den. These are inconsistencies; but
      they are inconsistencies which add, we think, to the interest of the
      narrative. We have not the least doubt that Bunyan had in view some stout
      old Greatheart of Naseby and Worcester, who prayed with his men before he
      drilled them, who knew the spiritual state of every dragoon in his troop,
      and who, with the praises of God in his mouth, and a two-edged sword in
      his hand, had turned to flight, on many fields of battle, the swearing,
      drunken bravoes of Rupert and Lunsford. <span class="pagenum">265</span><a
      name="link265_rdquo_________id_" id="link265_rdquo_________id_"></a> Every
      age produces such men as By-ends. But the middle of the seventeenth
      century was eminently prolific of such men. Mr. Southey thinks that the
      satire was aimed at some particular individual; and this seems by no means
      improbable. At all events, Bunyan must have known many of those hypocrites
      who followed religion only when religion walked in silver slippers, when
      the sun shone, and when the people applauded. Indeed he might have easily
      found all the kindred of By-ends among the public men of his time. He
      might have found among the peers my Lord Turnabout, my Lord Time-server,
      and my Lord Fair-speech; in the House of Commons, Mr. Smooth-man, Mr.
      Anything, and Mr. Facing-both-ways; nor would &ldquo;the parson of the
      parish, Mr. Two-tongues,&rdquo; have been wanting. The town of Bedford
      probably contained more than one politician who, after contriving to raise
      an estate by seeking the Lord during the reign of the saints, contrived to
      keep what he had got by persecuting the saints during the reign of the
      strumpets, and more than one priest who, during repeated changes in the
      discipline and doctrines of the church, had remained constant to nothing
      but his benefice.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most remarkable passages in the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress is
      that in which the proceedings against Faithful are described. It is
      impossible to doubt that Bunyan intended to satirise the mode in whieh
      state trials were conducted under Charles the Second. The license given to
      the witnesses for the prosecution, the shameless partiality and ferocious
      insolence of the judge, the precipitancy and the blind rancour of the
      jury, remind us of those odious mummeries which, from the Restoration to
      the Revolution, were merely forms preliminary to hanging, drawing, and
      quartering. <span class="pagenum">266</span><a name="link266" id="link266"></a>Lord
      Hategood performs the office of counsel for the prisoners as well as
      Scroggs himself could have performed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Judge. Thou runagate, heretic, and traitor, hast thou heard what
      these honest gentlemen have witnessed against thee? </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faithful. May I speak a few words in my own defence?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge. Sirrah, sirrah! thou deservest to live no longer, but to be
      slain immediately upon the place; yet, that all men may see our gentleness
      to thee, let us hear what thou, vile runagate, hast to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No person who knows the state trials can be at a loss for parallel cases.
      Indeed, write what Bunyan would, the baseness and cruelty of the lawyers
      of those times &ldquo;sinned up to it still,&rdquo; and even went beyond
      it. The imaginary trial of Faithful, before a jury composed of personified
      vices, was just and merciful, when compared with the real trial of Alice
      Lisle before that tribunal where all the vices sat in the person of
      Jefferies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The style of Bunyan is delightful to every reader, and invaluable as a
      study to every person who wishes to obtain a wide command over the English
      language. The vocabulary is the vocabulary of the common people. There is
      not an expression, if we except a few technical terms of theology, which
      would puzzle the rudest peasant. We have observed several pages which do
      not contain a single word of more than two syllables. Yet no writer has
      said more exactly what he meant to say. For magnificence, for pathos, for
      vehement exhortation, for subtle disquisition, for every purpose of the
      poet, the orator, and the divine, this homely dialect, the dialect of
      plain working men, was perfectly sufficient. There is no book in our
      literature on which we would so readily stake the fame of <span
      class="pagenum">267</span><a name="link267" id="link267"></a>the old
      unpolluted English language, no book which shows so well how rich that
      language is in its own proper wealth, and how little it has been improved
      by all that it has borrowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cowper said, forty or fifty years ago, that he dared not name John Bunyan
      in his verse, for fear of moving a sneer. To our refined forefathers, we
      suppose, Lord Roscommon&rsquo;s Essay on Translated Verse, and the Duke of
      Buckinghamshire&rsquo;s Essay on Poetry, appeared to be compositions
      infinitely superior to the allegory of the preaching tinker. We live in
      better times; and we are not afraid to say, that, though there were many
      clever men in England during the latter half of the seventeenth century,
      there were only two minds which possessed the imaginative faculty in a
      very eminent degree. One of those minds produced the Paradise Lost, the
      other the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress.

      SADLER&rsquo;S REFUTATION REFUTED. (1)
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (<i>Edinburg Review</i>, January 1831.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e <span
      class="pagenum">268</span><a name="link268" id="link268"></a>have, in
      violation of our usual practice, transcribed Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s title-page
      from top to bottom, motto and all. The parallel implied between the Essay
      on the Human Understanding and the Essay on Superfecundity is exquisitely
      laughable. We can match it, however, with mottoes as ludicrous. We
      remember to have heard of a dramatic piece, entitled &ldquo;News from
      Camperdown,&rdquo; written soon after Lord Duncan&rsquo;s victory, by a
      man once as much in his own good graces as Mr. Sadler is, and now as much
      forgotten as Mr. Sadler will soon be, Robert Heron. His piece was brought
      upon the stage, and damned, &ldquo;as it is phrased,&rdquo; in the second
      act; but the author, thinking that it had been unfairly and unjustly
      &ldquo;run down,&rdquo; published it, in order to put his critics to
      shame, with this motto from Swift:&mdash;&ldquo;When a true genius appears
      in the
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) <i>A Refutation of an Article in the Edinburgh Review (No.
     CII.) entitled, &ldquo;Sadler&rsquo;s Law of Population, and Disproof of
     Human Superfecundity;&rdquo; containing also Additional Proofs of
     the Principle enunciated in that Treatise, founded on the
     Censuses of different Countries recently published</i>. By
     Michael Thomas Sadler, M.P. 8vo. London: 1830.

     &ldquo;Before anything came out against my Essay, I was told I
     must prepare myself for a storm coming against it, it being
     resolved by some men that it was necessary that book of mine
     should, as it is phrased, be run down.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>John Locke</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">269</span><a name="link269" id="link269"></a>world,
      you may know him by this mark&mdash;that the dunces are all in confederacy
      against him.&rdquo; We remember another anecdote, which may perhaps be
      acceptable to so zealous a churchman as Mr. Sadler. A certain Antinomian
      preacher, the oracle of a barn, in a county of which we do not think it
      proper to mention the name, finding that divinity was not by itself a
      sufficiently lucrative profession, resolved to combine with it that of
      dog-stealing. He was, by ill-fortune, detected in several offences of this
      description, and was in consequence brought before two justices, who, in
      virtue of the powers given them by an act of parliament, sentenced him to
      a whipping for each theft. The degrading punishment inflicted on the
      pastor naturally thinned the flock; and the poor man was in danger of
      wanting bread. He accordingly put forth a handbill, solemnly protesting
      his innocence, describing his sufferings, and appealing to the Christian
      charity of the public; and to his pathetic address he prefixed this most
      appropriate text: &ldquo;Thrice was I beaten with rods.&mdash;<i>St. Paul&rsquo;s
      Epistle to the Corinthians</i>.&rdquo; He did not perceive that, though
      St. Paul had been scourged, no number of whippings, however severe, will
      of themselves entitle a man to be considered as an apostle. Mr. Sadler
      seems to us to have fallen into a somewhat similar error. He should
      remember that, though Locke may have been laughed at, so has Sir Claudius
      Hunter; and that it takes something more than the laughter of all the
      world to make a Locke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body of this pamphlet by no means justifies the parallel so modestly
      insinuated on the title-page. Yet we must own that, though Mr. Sadler has
      not risen to the level of Locke, he has done what was almost as difficult,
      if not as honourable&mdash;he has fallen below his <span class="pagenum">270</span><a
      name="link270" id="link270"></a>own. He is at best a bad writer. His
      arrangement is an elaborate confusion. His style has been constructed,
      with great care, in such a manner as to produce the least possible effect
      by means of the greatest possible number of words. Aspiring to the exalted
      character of a Christian philosopher, he can never preserve through a
      single paragraph either the calmness of a philosopher or the meekness of a
      Christian. His ill-nature would make a very little wit formidable. But,
      happily, his efforts to wound resemble those of a juggler&rsquo;s snake.
      The bags of poison are full, but the fang is wanting. In this foolish
      pamphlet, all the unpleasant peculiarities of his style and temper are
      brought out in the strongest manner. He is from the beginning to the end
      in a paroxysm of rage, and would certainly do us some mischief if he knew
      how. We will give a single instance for the present. Others will present
      themselves as we proceed. We laughed at some doggerel verses which he
      cited, and which we, never having seen them before, suspected to be his
      own. We are now sure that, if the principle on which Solomon decided a
      famous case of filiation were correct, there can be no doubt as to the
      justice of our suspicion. Mr. Sadler, who, whatever elements of the
      poetical character he may lack, possesses the poetical irritability in an
      abundance which might have sufficed for Homer himself, resolved to
      retaliate on the person, who, as he supposed, had reviewed him. He has,
      accordingly, ransacked some collection of college verses, in the hope of
      finding, among the performances of his supposed antagonist, something as
      bad as his own. And we must in fairness admit that he has succeeded pretty
      well. We must admit that the gentleman in question sometimes put into his
      exercises, at seventeen. <span class="pagenum">271</span><a
      name="link271_rdquo_________id_" id="link271_rdquo_________id_"></a>almost
      as great nonsense as Mr. Sadler is in the habit of putting into his books
      at sixty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sadler complains that we have devoted whole pages to mere abuse of
      him. We deny the charge. We have, indeed, characterised, in terms of just
      reprehension, that spirit which shows itself in every part of his prolix
      work. Those terms of reprehension we are by no means inclined to retract;
      and we conceive that we might have used much stronger expressions, without
      the least offence either to truth or to decorum. There is a limit
      prescribed to us by our sense of what is due to ourselves. But we think
      that no indulgence is due to Mr. Sadler. A writer who distinctly announces
      that he has not conformed to the candour of the age&mdash;who makes it his
      boast that he expresses himself throughout with the greatest plainness and
      freedom&mdash;and whose constant practice proves that by plainness and
      freedom he means coarseness and rancour&mdash;has no right to expect that
      others shall remember courtesies which he has forgotten, or shall respect
      one who has ceased to respect himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sadler declares that he has never vilified Mr. Malthus personally, and
      has confined himself to attacking the doctrines which that gentleman
      maintains. We should wish to leave that point to the decision of all who
      have read Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s book, or any twenty pages of it. To quote
      particular instances of a temper which penetrates and inspires the whole
      work, is to weaken our charge. Yet, that we may not be suspected of
      flinching, we will give two specimens,&mdash;the two first which occur to
      our recollection. &ldquo;Whose minister is it that speaks thus?&rdquo;
      says Mr. Sadler, after misrepresenting in a most extraordinary manner,
      though, we are willing to believe, unintentionally, one of the positions
      <span class="pagenum">272</span><a name="link272" id="link272"></a>of Mr.
      Malthus. &ldquo;Whose minister is it that speaks thus? That of the lover
      and avenger of little children?&rdquo; Again, Mr. Malthus recommends,
      erroneously perhaps, but assuredly from humane motives, that alms, when
      given, should be given very sparingly. Mr. Sadler quotes the
      recommendation, and adds the following courteous comment:&mdash;&ldquo;The
      tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.&rdquo; We cannot think that a
      writer who indulges in these indecent and unjust attacks on professional
      and personal character has any right to complain of our sarcasms on his
      metaphors and rhymes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will now proceed to examine the reply which Mr. Sadler has thought fit
      to make to our arguments. He begins by attacking our remarks on the origin
      of evil. They are, says he, too profound for common apprehension; and he
      hopes that they are too profound for our own. That they seem profound to
      him we can well believe. Profundity, in its secondary as in its primary
      sense, is a relative term. When Grihlrig was nearly drowned in the
      Brobdignagian cream-jug he doubtless thought it very deep. But to common
      apprehension our reasoning would, we are persuaded, appear perfectly
      simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theory of Mr. Malthus, says Mr. Sadler, cannot be true, because it
      asserts the existence of a great and terrible evil, and is therefore
      inconsistent with the goodness of God. We answer thus. We know that there
      are in the world great and terrible evils. In spite of these evils, we
      believe in the goodness of God. Why may we not then continue to believe in
      his goodness, though another evil should be added to the list?
    </p>
    <p>
      How does Mr. Sadler answer this? Merely by telling <span class="pagenum">273</span><a
      name="link273" id="link273"></a>us that we are too wicked to be reasoned
      with. He completely shrinks from the question; a question, be it
      remembered, not raised by us&mdash;a question which we should have felt
      strong objections to raising unnecessarily&mdash;a question put forward by
      himself, as intimately connected with the subject of his two ponderous
      volumes. He attempts to carp at detached parts of our reasoning on the
      subject. &ldquo;With what success he carries on this guerilla war after
      declining a general action with the main body of our argument our readers
      shall see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The reviewer sends me to Paley, who is, I confess, rather more
      intelligible on the subject, and who, fortunately, has decided the very
      point in dispute. I will first give the words of the reviewer, who, when
      speaking of my general argument regarding the magnitude of the evils,
      moral and physical, implied in the theory I oppose, sums up his ideas
      thus:&mdash;&lsquo;Mr. Sadler says, that it is not a light or transient
      evil, but a great and permanent evil. What then? The question of the
      origin of evil is a question of av or no,&mdash;not a question of more or
      less.&rsquo; But what says Paley? His express rule is this, that &lsquo;when
      we cannot resolve all appearances into benevolence of design, we make the
      few give place to the many, the little to the great; that we take our
      judgment from a large and decided preponderancy.&rsquo; Now in weighing
      these two authorities, directly at issue on this point, I think there will
      be little trouble in determining which we shall make &lsquo;to give place
      or, if we &lsquo;look to a large and decided preponderance&rsquo; of
      either talent, learning, or benevolence, from whom we shall &lsquo;take
      our judgment.&rsquo; The effrontery, or, to speak more charitably, the
      ignorance of a reference to Paley on this subject, and in this instance is
      really marvellous.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, does not Mr. Sadler see that the very words which he quotes from
      Paley contain in themselves a refutation of his whole argument? Paley
      says, indeed, as every man in his senses would say, that in a certain
      case, which he has specified, the more and the less <span class="pagenum">274</span><a
      name="link274" id="link274"></a>come into question. But in what case?
      &ldquo;When we <i>cannot</i> resolve all appearances into the benevolence
      of design.&rdquo; It is better that there should be a little evil than a
      great deal of evil. This is self-evident. But it is also self-evident that
      no evil is better than a little evil. Why, then, is there any evil? It is
      a mystery which we cannot solve. It is a mystery which Paley, by the very
      words which Mr. Sadler has quoted, acknowledges himself unable to solve;
      and it is because he cannot solve that mystery that he proceeds to take
      into consideration the more and the less. Believing in the divine
      goodness, we must necessarily believe that the evils which exist are
      necessary to avert greater evils. But what those greater evils are we do
      not know. How the happiness of any part of the sentient creation would be
      in any respect diminished if, for example, children cut their teeth
      without pain, we cannot understand. The case is exactly the same with the
      principle of Mr. Malthus. If superfecundity exists, it exists, no doubt,
      because it is a less evil than some other evil which otherwise would
      exist. Can Mr. Sadin his senses would say, that in a certain case, which
      he has specified, the more and the less <span class="pagenum">274</span><a
      name="link274_rdquo_________id_" id="link274_rdquo_________id_"></a>come
      into question. But in what case? &ldquo;When we <i>cannot</i> resolve all
      appearances into the benevolence of design.&rdquo; It is better that there
      should be a little evil than a great deal of evil. This is self-evident.
      But it is also self-evident that no evil is better than a little evil.
      Why, then, is there any evil? It is a mystery which we cannot solve. It is
      a mystery which Paley, by the very words which Mr. Sadler has quoted,
      acknowledges himself unable to solve; and it is because he cannot solve
      that mystery that he proceeds to take into consideration the more and the
      less. Believing in the divine goodness, we must necessarily believe that
      the evils which exist are necessary to avert greater evils. But what those
      greater evils are we do not know. How the happiness of any part of the
      sentient creation would be in any respect diminished if, for example,
      children cut their teeth without pain, we cannot understand. The case is
      exactly the same with the principle of Mr. Malthus. If superfecundity
      exists, it exists, no doubt, because it is a less evil than some other
      evil which otherwise would exist. Can Mr. Sadler prove that this is an
      impossibility?
    </p>
    <p>
      One single expression which Mr. Sadler employs on this subject is
      sufficient to show how utterly incompetent he is to discuss it. &ldquo;On
      the Christian hypothesis,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;no doubt exists as to the
      origin of evil.&rdquo; He does not, we think, understand what is meant by
      the origin of evil. The Christian Scriptures profess to give no solution
      of that mystery. They relate facts; but they leave the metaphysical
      question undetermined. They tell us that man fell; but why he was not so
      constituted as to be incapable of falling, or why the Supreme Being has
      not mitigated the consequences of the Fall more than they actually have
      been mitigated, the <span class="pagenum">275</span><a
      name="link275_rdquo_________id_" id="link275_rdquo_________id_"></a>Scriptures
      did not tell us, and, it may without presumption be said, could not tell
      us, unless we had been creatures different from what we are. There is
      something, either in the nature of our faculties or in the nature of the
      machinery employed by us for the purpose of reasoning, which condemns us,
      on this and similar subjects, to hopeless ignorance. Man can understand
      these high matters only by ceasing to be man, just as a fly can understand
      a lemma of Newton only by ceasing to be a fly. To make it an objection to
      the Christian system that it gives us no solution of these difficulties,
      is to make it an objection to the Christian system that it is a system
      formed for human beings. Of the puzzles of the Academy, there is not one
      which does not apply as strongly to Deism as to Christianity, and to
      Atheism as to Deism. There are difficulties in everything. Yet we are sure
      that something must be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      If revelation speaks on the subject of the origin of evil it speaks only
      to discourage dogmatism and temerity. In the most ancient, the most
      beautiful, and the most profound of all works on the subject, the Book of
      Job, both the sufferer who complains of the divine government, and the
      injudicious advisers who attempt to defend it on wrong principles, are
      silenced by the voice of supreme wisdom, and reminded that the question is
      beyond the reach of the human intellect. St. Paul silences the supposed
      objector, who strives to force him into controversy, in the same manner.
      The church has been, ever since the apostolic times, agitated by this
      question, and by a question which is inseparable from it, the question of
      fate and free-will. The greatest theologians and philosophers have
      acknowledged that these things were too high for them, and have contented
      <span class="pagenum">276</span><a name="link276" id="link276"></a>themselves
      with hinting at what seemed to be the most probable solution. What says
      Johnson? &ldquo;All our effort ends in belief that for the evils of life
      there is some good reason, and in confession that the reason cannot be
      found.&rdquo; What says Paley? &ldquo;Of the origin of evil no universal
      solution has been discovered. I mean no solution which reaches to all
      cases of complaint.&mdash;The consideration of general laws, although it
      may concern the question of the origin of evil very nearly, which I think
      it does, rests in views disproportionate to our faculties, and in a
      knowledge which we do not possess. It serves rather to account for the
      obscurity of the subject, than to supply us with distinct answers to our
      difficulties.&rdquo; What says presumptuous ignorance? &ldquo;No doubt
      whatever exists as to the origin of evil.&rdquo; It is remarkable that Mr.
      Sadler does not tell us what his solution is. The world, we suspect, will
      lose little by his silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He falls on the reviewer again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Though I have shown,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and on authorities
      from which none can lightly differ, not only the cruelty and immorality
      which this system necessarily involves, but its most revolting feature,
      its gross partiality, he has wholly suppressed this, the most important
      part of my argument; as even the bare notice of it would have instantly
      exposed the sophistry to which he has had recourse. If, however, he would
      Fairly meet the whole question, let him show me that &lsquo;hydrophobia,&rsquo;
      which he gives as an example of the laws of God and nature, is a calamity
      to which the poor alone are liable; or that &lsquo;malaria,&rsquo; which,
      with singular infelicity, he has chosen as an illustration of the fancied
      evils of population, is a respecter of persons.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We said nothing about this argument, as Mr. Sadler calls it, merely
      because we did not think it worth while; and we are half ashamed to say
      anything about it now. But, since Mr. Sadler is so urgent for an answer,
      <span class="pagenum">277</span><a name="link277" id="link277"></a>he
      shall have one. If there is evil, it must be either partial or universal.
      Which is the better of the two? Hydrophobia, says this great philosopher,
      is no argument against the divine goodness, because mad dogs bite rich and
      poor alike; but, if the rich were exempted, and only nine people suffered
      for ten who suffer now, hydrophobia would forthwith, simply because it
      would produce less evil than at present, become an argument against the
      divine goodness! To state such a proposition, is to refute it. And is not
      the malaria a respecter of persons? It infests Rome. Does it infest
      London? There are complaints peculiar to the tropical countries. There are
      others which are found only in mountainous districts; others which are
      confined to marshy regions; others again which run in particular families.
      Is not this partiality? Why is it more inconsistent with the divine
      goodness that poor men should suffer an evil from which rich men are
      exempt, than that a particular portion of the community should inherit
      gout, scrofula, insanity, and other maladies? And are there no miseries
      under which, in fact, the poor alone are suffering? Mr. Sadler himself
      acknowledges, in this very paragraph, that there are such; but he tells us
      that these calamities are the effects of misgovernment, and that this
      misgovernment is the effect of political economy. Be it so. But does he
      not see that he is only removing the difficulty one step farther? Why does
      Providence suffer men, whose minds are filled with false and pernicious
      notions, to have power in the state? For good ends, we doubt not, if the
      fact be so; but for ends inscrutable to us, who see only a small part of
      the vast scheme, and who see that small part only for a short period. Does
      Mr. Sadler doubt that the Supreme Being has power as absolute <span
      class="pagenum">278</span><a name="link278" id="link278"></a>over the
      revolutions of political as over the organisation of natural bodies?
      Surely not: and, if not, we do not see that he vindicates the ways of
      Providence by attributing the distresses, which the poor, as he confesses,
      endure, to an error in legislation rather than to a law of physiology.
      Turn the question as we may, disguise it as we may, we shall find that it
      at last resolves itself into the same great enigma,&mdash;the origin of
      physical and moral evil: an enigma which the highest human intellects have
      given up in despair, but which Mr. Sadler thinks himself perfectly able to
      solve.
    </p>
    <p>
      He next accuses us of having paused long on verbal criticism. We certainly
      did object to his improper use of the words, &ldquo;inverse variation.&rdquo;
      Mr. Sadler complains of this with his usual bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Now what is the Reviewer&rsquo;s quarrel with me on this
      occasion? That he does not understand the meaning of my terms? No. He
      acknowledges the contrary. That I have not fully explained the sense in
      which I lave used them? No. An explanation, he knows, is immediately
      subjoined, though he has carefully suppressed it. That I have varied the
      sense in which I have applied them? No. I challenge him to show it. But he
      nevertheless goes on for many pages together in arguing against what he
      knows, and, in fact, acknowledges, I did not mean; and then turns round
      and argues again, though much more feebly, indeed, against what he says I
      did mean! Now, even had I been in error as to the use of a word, I appeal
      to the reader whether such an unworthy and disingenuous course would not,
      if generally pursued, make controversy on all subjects, however important,
      that into which, in such hands, it always degenerates&mdash;a dispute
      about words.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The best way to avoid controversies about words is to use words in their
      proper senses. Mr. Sadler may think our objection captious; but how he can
      think it disingenuous we do not well understand. If we had <span
      class="pagenum">279</span><a name="link279" id="link279"></a>represented
      him as meaning what we knew that he did not mean, we should have acted in
      a disgraceful manner. But we did not represent him, and he allows that we
      did not represent him, as meaning what he did not mean. We blamed him, and
      with perfect justice and propriety, for saying what he did not mean. Every
      man has in one sense a right to define his own terms; that is to say, if
      he chooses to call one two, and two seven, it would be absurd to charge
      him with false arithmetic for saying that seven is the double of one. But
      it would be perfectly fair to blame him for changing the established sense
      of words. The words, &ldquo;inverse variation,&rdquo; in matters not
      purely scientific, have often been used in the loose way in which Mr.
      Sadler has used them. But we shall be surprised if he can find a single
      instance of their having been so used in a matter of pure arithmetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will illustrate our meaning thus. Lord Thur-low, in one of his speeches
      about Indian affairs, said that one Hastings was worth twenty Macartneys.
      He might, with equal propriety, have said ten Macartneys, or a hundred
      Macartneys. Nor would there have been the least inconsistency in his using
      all the three expressions in one speech. But would this be an excuse for a
      financier who, in a matter of account, should reason as if ten, twenty,
      and a hundred were the same number?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sadler tells us that he purposely avoided the use of the word
      proportion in stating his principle. He seems, therefore, to allow that
      the word proportion would have been improper. Yet he did in fact employ it
      in explaining his principle, accompanied with an awkward explanation
      intended to signify that, though he said proportion, he meant something
      quite different <span class="pagenum">280</span><a
      name="link280_rdquo_________id_" id="link280_rdquo_________id_"></a>from
      proportion. We should not have said so much on this subject, either in our
      former article, or at present, but that there is in all Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s
      writings an air of scientific pedantry, which renders his errors fair
      game. We will now let the matter rest; and, instead of assailing Mr.
      Sadler with our verbal criticism, proceed to defend ourselves against his
      literal criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The Reviewer promised his readers that some curious results
      should follow from his shuffling. We will enable him to keep his word.
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In two English counties,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;which
      contain from 50 to 100 inhabitants on the square mile, the births to 100
      marriages are, according to Mr. Sadler, 420; but in 44 departments of
      France, in which there are from one to two hecatares [hectares] to each
      inhabitant, that is to say, in which the population is from 125 to 250, or
      rather more, to the square mile, the number of births to one hundred
      marriages is 423 and a fraction.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first curious result is, that our Reviewer is ignorant, not
      only of the name, but of the extent, of a French hectare; otherwise he is
      guilty of a practice which, even if transferred to the gambling-table,
      would, I presume, prevent him from being allowed ever to shuffle, even
      there, again. He was most ready to pronounce upon a mistake of one per
      cent, in a calculation of mine, the difference in no wise affecting the
      argument in hand; but here I must inform him, that his error, whether
      wilfully or ignorantly put forth, involves his entire argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The French hectare I had calculated to contain 107708 67/100
      English square feet, or 247265 acres; Dr. Kelly takes it, on authority
      which he gives, at 107644 English square feet. The last French Annuaires,
      however, state it, I perceive, as being equal to 2473914 acres. The
      difference is very trifling, and will not in the slightest degree cover
      our critic&rsquo;s error. When, therefore, the Reviewer calculates the
      population of the departments of France thus: &lsquo;from one to two
      hectares to each inhabitant, that is to say, in which the population is
      from 125 to 250, or rather more, to the square mile; his &lsquo;that <span
      class="pagenum">281</span><a name="link281" id="link281"></a>is to say&rsquo;
      is that which he ought not to have said&mdash;no rare case with him, as we
      shall show throughout.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We must inform Mr. Sadler, in the first place, that we inserted the vowel
      which amuses him so much, not from ignorance or from carelessness, but
      advisedly, and in conformity with the practice of several respectable
      writers. He will find the word hecatare in Rees&rsquo;s Cyclopaedia. He
      will find it also in Dr. Young. We prefer the form which we have employed,
      because it is etymologically correct. Mr. Sadler seems not to know that a
      hecatare is so called, because it contains a hundred acres.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were perfectly acquainted with the extent as well as with the name of a
      hecatare. Is it at all strange that we should use the words &ldquo;250, or
      rather more,&rdquo; in speaking of 258 and a fraction? Do not people
      constantly employ round numbers with still greater looseness, in
      translating foreign distances and foreign money? If indeed, as Mr. Sadler
      says, the difference which he chooses to call an error involved the entire
      argument, or any part of the argument, we should have been guilty of gross
      unfairness. But it is not so. The difference between 258 and 250, as even
      Mr. Sadler would see if he were not blind with fury, was a difference to
      his advantage. Our point was this. The fecundity of a dense population in
      certain departments of France is greater than that of a thinly scattered
      population in certain counties of England. The more dense, therefore, the
      population in those departments of France, the stronger was our case. By
      putting 250, instead of 258, we understated our case. Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s
      correction of our orthography leads us to suspect that he knows very
      little of Greek; and his <span class="pagenum">282</span><a name="link282"
      id="link282"></a>correction of our calculation quite satisfies us that he
      knows very little of logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, to come to the gist of the controversy. Our argument, drawn from Mr.
      Sadler&rsquo;s own Tables, remains absolutely untouched. He makes excuses
      indeed; for an excuse is the last thing that Mr. Sadler will ever want.
      There is something half laughable and half provoking in the facility with
      which he asserts and retracts, says and unsays, exactly as suits his
      argument. Sometimes the register of baptisms is imperfect, and sometimes
      the register of burials. Then again these registers become all at once
      exact almost to an unit. He brings forward a census of Prussia in proof of
      his theory. We show that it directly confutes his theory; and it forthwith
      becomes &ldquo;notoriously and grossly defective.&rdquo; The census of the
      Netherlands is not to be easily dealt with; and the census of the
      Netherlands is therefore pronounced inaccurate. In his book on the Law of
      Population, he tells us that &ldquo;in the slave-holding States of
      America, the male slaves constitute a decided majority of that unfortunate
      class.&rdquo; This fact, we turned against him; and, forgetting that he
      had himself stated it, he tells that &ldquo;it is as erroneous as many
      other ideas which we entertain,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;he will venture to
      assert that the female slaves were, at the nubile age, as numerous as the
      males.&rdquo; The increase of the negroes in the United States puzzles
      him; and he creates a vast slave trade to solve it. He confounds together
      things perfectly different; the slave-trade carried on under the American
      flag, and the slave-trade carried on for the supply of the American soil,&mdash;the
      slave-trade with Africa, and the internal slave-trade between the
      different States. He exaggerates a few occasional acts of smuggling into
      <span class="pagenum">283</span><a name="link283_rdquo_________id_"
      id="link283_rdquo_________id_"></a>an immense and regular importation, and
      makes his escape as well as he can under cover of this hubbub of words.
      Documents are authentic and facts true precisely in proportion to the
      support which they afford to his theory. This is one way, undoubtedly, of
      making books: but we question much whether it be the way to make
      discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the inconsistencies which we pointed out between his theory and his
      own tables, he finds no difficulty in explaining them away or facing them
      out. In one case there would have been no contradiction if, instead of
      taking one of his tables, we had multiplied the number of three tables
      together, and taken the average. Another would never have existed if there
      had not been a great migration of people into Lancashire. Another is not
      to be got over by any device. But then it is very small, and of no
      consequence to the argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, indeed, he is perhaps right. The inconsistencies which we noticed
      were, in themselves, of little moment. We gave them as samples,&mdash;as
      mere hints, to caution those of our readers who might also happen to be
      readers of Mil Sadler against being deceived by his packing. He complains
      of the word packing. We repeat it; and, since he has defied us to the
      proof, we will go fully into the question which, in our last article, we
      only glanced at, and prove, in such a manner as shall not leave even to
      Mr. Sadler any shadow of excuse, that his theory owes its speciousness to
      packing, and to packing alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      That our readers may fully understand our reasoning, we will again state
      what Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s proportion is. He asserts that, on a given space,
      the number of children to a marriage becomes less and <span class="pagenum">284</span><a
      name="link284" id="link284"></a>less as the population becomes more and
      more numerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will begin with the censuses of France given by Mr. Sadler. By joining
      the departments together in combinations which suit his purpose, he has
      contrived to produce three tables, which he presents as decisive proofs of
      his theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first is as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The legitimate births are, in those departments where there are to
      each inhabitant&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0008" id="linkimage-0008"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0290.jpg" alt="0290 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0290.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      These tables, as we said in our former article, certainly look well for
      Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s theory. &ldquo;Do they?&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Assuredly
      they do; and in admitting this, the Reviewer has admitted the theory to be
      proved.&rdquo; We cannot absolutely agree to this. A theory is not proved,
      we must tell Mr. Sadler, merely because the <span class="pagenum">285</span><a
      name="link285" id="link285"></a>evidence in its favour looks well at first
      sight. There is an old proverb, very homely in expression, but well
      deserving to be had in constant remembrance by all men, engaged either in
      action or in speculation&mdash;&ldquo;One story is good till another is
      told!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We affirm, then, that the results which these tables present, and which
      seem so favourable to Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s theory, are produced by packing,
      and by packing alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, if we look at the departments singly, the whole is in
      disorder. About the department in which Paris is situated there is no
      dispute: Mr. Malthas distinctly admits that great cities prevent
      propagation. There remain eighty-four departments; and of these there is
      not, we believe, a single one in the place which, according to Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s
      principle, it ought to occupy.
    </p>
    <p>
      That which ought to be highest in fecundity is tenth in one table,
      fourteenth in another, and only thirty-first according to the third. That
      which ought to be third is twenty-second by the table, which places it
      highest. That which ought to be fourth is fortieth by the table, which
      places it highest. That which ought to be eighth is fiftieth or sixtieth.
      That which ought to be tenth from the top is at about the same distance
      from the bottom. On the other hand, that which, according to Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s
      principle, ought to be last but two of all the eighty-four is third in two
      of the tables, and seventh in that which places it lowest; and that which
      ought to be last is, in one of Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s tables, above that which
      ought to be first, in two of them, above that which ought to be third,
      and, in all of them, above that which ought to be fourth.
    </p>
    <p>
      By dividing the departments in a particular manner, <span class="pagenum">286</span><a
      name="link286" id="link286"></a>Mr. Sadler has produced results which he
      contemplates with great satisfaction. But, if we draw the lines a little
      higher up or a little lower down, we shall find that all his calculations
      are thrown into utter confusion; and that the phenomena, if they indicate
      any thing, indicate a law the very reverse of that which he has
      propounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us take, for example, the thirty-two departments, as they stand in Mr.
      Sadler&rsquo;s table, from Loz√®re to Meuse inclusive, and divide them into
      two sets of sixteen departments each. The set from Loz√®re and Loiret
      inclusive consists of those departments in which the space to each
      inhabitant is from 3.8 hecatares to 2.42. The set from Cantal to Meuse
      inclusive consists of those departments in which the space to each
      inhabitant is from 2.42 hecatares to 2.07. That is to say, in the former
      set the inhabitants are from 68 to 107 on the square mile, or thereabouts.
      In the latter they are from 107 to 125. Therefore, on Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s
      principle, the fecundity ought to be smaller in the latter set than in the
      former. It is, however, greater, and that in every one of Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s
      three tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now go a little lower down, and take another set of sixteen
      departments&mdash;those which lie together in Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s tables,
      from H√©rault to Jura inclusive. Here the population is still thicker than
      in the second of those sets which we before compared. The fecundity,
      therefore, ought, on Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s principle, to be less than in that
      set. But it is again greater, and that in all Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s three
      tables. We have a regularly ascending series, where, if his theory had any
      truth in it, we ought to have a regularly descending series. We will give
      the results of our calculation.

      name="link287" id="link287"></a>We will give another instance, if possible
      still more decisive. We will take the three departments of France which
      ought, on Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s principle, to be the lowest in fecundity of
      all the eighty-five, saving only that in which Paris stands; and we will
      compare them with the three departments in which the fecundity ought,
      according to him, to be greater than in any other department of France,
      two only excepted. We will compare Bas Rhin, Rhone, and Nord, with Loz√®re,
      Landes, and Indre. In Loz√®re, Landes, and Indre, the population is from 68
      to 84 on the square mile, or nearly so. In Bas Rhin, Rhone, and Nord, it
      is from 300 to 417 on the square mile. There cannot be a more overwhelming
      answer to Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s theory than the table which we subjoin:
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of births to 1000 marriages is&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Take the whole of the third, fourth, and fifth divisions into which Mr.
      Sadler has portioned out the French departments. These three divisions
      make up almost the whole kingdom of France. They contain seventy-nine out
      of the eighty-five departments. Mr. Sadler has contrived to divide them in
      such a manner that, to a person who looks merely at his averages, the
      fecundity seems to diminish as the population thickens. We will separate
      them into two parts instead of three. We will draw the line between the
      department of Gironde and that of H√©rault. On the one side are the
      thirty-two departments from Cher to Gironde inclusive. On the other side
      are the forty-six departments from H√©rault to Nord inclusive. In all the
      departments of the former set, the population is under 132 on the square
      mile. In all the departments of the latter set, it is above 132 on the
      square mile. It is clear that, if there be one word of truth in MV. Sadler&rsquo;s
      theory, the fecundity in the latter of these divisions must be very
      decidedly smaller than in the former. Is it so? It is, on the contrary,
      greater in all the three tables. We give the result.

      there are from 132 to 41.7 people on the square mile....
    </p>
    <p>
      This fact is alone enough to decide the question. Yet it is only one of a
      crowd of similar facts. If the <span class="pagenum">289</span><a
      name="link289" id="link289"></a>line between Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s second and
      third divisions be drawn six departments lower down, the third and fourth
      divisions will, in all the tables, be above the second. If the line
      between the third and fourth divisions he drawn two departments lower
      down, the fourth division will be above the third in all the tables. If
      the line between the fourth and fifth divisions be drawn two departments
      lower down, the fifth will, in all the tables, be above the fourth, above
      the third, and even above the second. How then has Mr. Sadler obtained his
      results? By packing solely. By placing in one compartment a district no
      larger than the Isle of Wight; in another, a district somewhat less than
      Yorkshire; in a third, a territory much larger than the island of Great
      Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the same artifice it is that he has obtained from the census of England
      those delusive averages which he brings forward with the utmost
      ostentation in proof of his principle. We will examine the facts relating
      to England, as we have examined those relating to F rance.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we look at the counties one by one, Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s principle
      utterly fails. Hertfordshire with 251 on the square mile; Worcestershire
      with 258; and Kent with 282, exhibit a far greater fecundity than the
      East-Riding of York, which has 151 on the square mile; Monmouthshire,
      which has 145; or Northumberland, which has 108. The fecundity of
      Staffordshire, which has more than 300 on the square mile, is as high as
      the average fecundity of the counties which have from 150 to 200 on the
      square mile. But, instead of confining ourselves to particular instances,
      we will try masses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take the eight counties of England which stand together in <span
      class="pagenum">290</span><a name="link290" id="link290"></a>Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s
      list, from Cumberland to Dorset inclusive. In these the population is from
      107 to 150 on the square mile. Compare with these the eight counties from
      Berks to Durham inclusive, in which the population is from 175 to 200 on
      the square mile. Is the fecundity in the latter counties smaller than in
      the former? On the contrary, the result stands thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of children to 100 marriages is&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the eight counties of England, in which there are from 107 to 146
      people on the square mile 388 In the eight counties of England, in which
      there are from 175 to 200 people on the square mile 402 Take the six
      districts from the East-Riding of York to the County of Norfolk inclusive.
      Here the population is from 150 to 170 on the square mile. To these oppose
      the six counties from Derby to Worcester inclusive. The population is from
      200 to 260. Here again we find that a law, directly the reverse of that
      which Mr. Sadler has laid down, appears to regulate the fecundity of the
      inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of children to 100 marriages is&mdash;
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      But we will make another experiment on Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s tables, if
      possible more decisive than any of those which we have hitherto made. We
      will take the four largest divisions into which he has distributed the
      English counties, and which follow each other in regular order. That our
      readers may fully comprehend the nature of that packing by which his
      theory is supported, we will set before them this part of his table.

    </p>
    <p>
      The difference is small, but not smaller than differences which Mr. Sadler
      has brought forward as proofs of his theory. We say, that these English
      tables no more prove that fecundity increases with the population than
      that it diminishes with the population. The thirty-four counties which we
      have taken make up, at least, four-fifths of the kingdom: and we see that,
      through those thirty-four counties, the phenomena are directly opposed to
      Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s principle. That in the capital, and in great
      manufacturing towns, marriages are less prolific than in the open country,
      we admit, and Mr. Malthus admits. But that any condensation of the
      population, short of that which injures all physical energies, will
      diminish the prolific powers of man, is, from these very tables of Mr.
      Sadler, completely disproved.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is scarcely worth while to proceed with instances, after proofs so
      overwhelming as those which we have given. Yet we will show that Mr.
      Sadler has formed his averages on the census of Prussia by an artifice
      exactly similar to that which we have already exposed.

    <p>
      We will go no farther with this examination. In fact, we have nothing more
      to examine. The tables which we have scrutinised constitute the whole
      strength of Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s case; and we confidently leave it to our
      readers to say, whether we have not shown that the strength of his case is
      weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be it remembered too that we are reasoning on data furnished by Mr. Sadler
      himself. We have not made collections of facts to set against his, as we
      easily might have done. It is on his own showing, it is out of his own
      mouth, that his theory stands condemned.
    </p>
    <p>
      That packing which we have exposed is not the only sort of packing which
      Mr. Sadler has practised. We mentioned in our review some facts relating
      to the towns of England, which appear from Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s tables, and
      which it seems impossible to explain if his principles be sound. The
      average fecundity of a marriage in towns of fewer than 3000 inhabitants is
      greater than the average fecundity of the kingdom. The average fecundity
      in towns of from 4000 to 5000 inhabitants is greater than the average
      fecundity of Warwickshire, Lancashire, or Surrey. How is it, we asked,
      <span class="pagenum">295</span><a name="link295" id="link295"></a>if Mr.
      Sadler&rsquo;s principle be correct, that the fecundity of Guildford
      should be greater than the average fecundity of the county in which it
      stands?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sadler, in reply, talks about &ldquo;the absurdity of comparing the
      fecundity in the small towns alluded to with that In the counties of
      Warwick and Stafford, or those of Lancaster and Surrey.&rdquo; He proceeds
      thus&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>In Warwickshire, far above half the population is comprised in
      large towns, including, of course, the immense metropolis of one great
      branch of oui&rsquo; manufactures, Birmingham. In the county of Stafford,
      besides the large and populous towns in its iron districts, situated so
      close together as almost to form, for considerable distances, a continuous
      street; there is, in its potteries, a great population, recently
      accumulated, not included, indeed, in the towns distinctly enumerated in
      the censuses, but vastly exceeding in its condensation that found in the
      places to which the Reviewer alludes. In Lancashire again, to which he
      also appeals, one-fourth of the entire population is made up of the
      inhabitants of two only of the towns of that county; far above half of it
      is contained in towns, compared with which those he refers to are
      villages; even the hamlets of the manufacturing parts of Lancashire are
      often far more populous than the places he mentions. But he presents us
      with a climax of absurdity in appealing lastly to the population of Surrey
      as quite rural compared with that of the twelve towns, having less than
      5000 inhabitants in their respective jurisdictions, such as
      Saffron-Walden, Monmouth, &amp;c. Now, in the last census, Surrey numbered
      398,658 inhabitants, and, to say not a word about the other towns of the
      county, much above two hundred thousands of these are within the Bills of
      mortality! &lsquo;We should, therefore, be glad to know&rsquo; how it is
      utterly inconsistent with my principle that the fecundity of Guildford,
      which numbers about 3000 inhabitants, should be greater than the average
      fecundity of Surrey, made up, as the bulk of the population of Surrey is,
      of the inhabitants of some of the worst parts of the metropolis? Or why
      the fecundity of a given number of marriages in the eleven little rural
      towns he alludes to, being somewhat higher than that of an equal number,
      half taken for instance, from the heart of Birmingham or Manchester, and
      half from the populous districts by which they are surrounded, is
      inconsistent with my theory</i>?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">296</span><a name="link296" id="link296"></a>&ldquo;<i>Had
      the Reviewer&rsquo;s object, in this instance, been to discover the truth,
      or had he known how to pursue it, it is perfectly clear, at first sight,
      that he would not have instituted a comparison between the prolificness
      which exists in the small towns he has alluded to, and that in certain
      districts, the population of which is made up, partly of rural inhabitants
      and partly of accumulations of people in immense masses, the prolificness
      of which, if he will allow me still the use of the phrase, is inversely as
      their magnitude; but he would have compared these small towns with the
      country places properly so called, and then again the different classes of
      towns with each other; this method would have led hint to certain
      conclusions on the subject.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, this reply shows that Mr. Sadler does not in the least understand the
      principle which he has himself laid down. What is that principle? It is
      this, that the fecundity of human beings <i>on given spaces</i>, varies
      inversely as their numbers. We know what he means by inverse variation.
      But we must suppose that he uses the words, &ldquo;given spaces&rdquo; in
      the proper sense. Given spaces are equal spaces. Is there any reason to
      believe, that in those parts of Surrey which lie within the bills of
      mortality there is any space, equal in area to the space on which
      Guildford stands, which is more thickly peopled than the space on which
      Guildford stands? We do not know that there is any such. We are sure that
      there are not many. Why, therefore, on Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s principle,
      should the people of Guildford be more prolific than the people who live
      within the bills of mortality? And, if the people of Guildford ought, as
      on Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s principle they unquestionably ought, to stand as low
      in the scale of fecundity as the people of Southwark itself, it follows,
      most clearly, that they ought to stand far lower than the average obtained
      by taking all the people of Surrey together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same remark applies to the case of Birmingham, <span class="pagenum">297</span><a
      name="link297" id="link297"></a>and to all the other eases which Mr.
      Sadler mentions. &ldquo;Towns of 5000 inhabitants may be, and often are,
      as thickly peopled, on a given space,&rdquo; as Birmingham. They are, in
      other words, as thickly peopled as a portion of Birmingham, equal to them
      in area. If so, on Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s principle, they ought to be as low
      in the scale of fecundity as Birmingham. But they are not so. On the
      contrary, they stand higher than the average obtained by taking the
      fecundity of Birmingham in combination with the fecundity of the rural
      districts of Warwickshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plain fact is, that Mr. Sadler has confounded the population of a city
      with its population &ldquo;on a given space,&rdquo;&mdash;a mistake which,
      in a gentleman who assures us that mathematical science was one of his
      early and favourite studies, is somewhat curious. It is as absurd, on his
      principle, to say that the fecundity of London ought to be less than the
      fecundity of Edinburgh, because London has a greater population than
      Edinburgh, as to say that the fecundity of Russia ought to be greater than
      that of England, because Russia has a greater population than England. He
      cannot say that the spaces on which towns stand are too small to exemplify
      the truth of his principle. For he has himself brought forward the scale
      of fecundity in towns, as a proof of his principle. And, in the very
      passage which we quoted above, he tells us that, if we knew how to pursue
      truth, or wished to find it, we &ldquo;should have compared these small
      towns with country places, and the different classes of towns with each
      other.&rdquo; That is to say, we ought to compare together such unequal
      spaces as give results favourable to his theory, and never to compare such
      equal spaces as give results opposed to it. Does he mean <span
      class="pagenum">298</span><a name="link298" id="link298"></a>any thing by
      &ldquo;a given space?&rdquo; Or does he mean merely such a space as suits
      his argument? It is perfectly clear that, if he is allowed to take this
      course, he may prove any thing. No fact can come amiss to him. Suppose,
      for example, that the fecundity of New York should prove to be smaller
      than the fecundity of Liverpool. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; says Mr. Sadler,
      &ldquo;makes for my theory. For there are more people within two miles of
      the Broadway of New York, than within two miles of the Exchange of
      Liverpool.&rdquo; Suppose, on the other hand, that the fecundity of New
      York should be greater than the fecundity of Liverpool. &ldquo;This,&rdquo;
      says Mr. Sadler again, &ldquo;is an unanswerable proof of my theory. For
      there are many more people within forty miles of Liverpool than within
      forty miles of New York.&rdquo; In order to obtain his numbers, he takes
      spaces in any combinations which may suit him. In order to obtain his
      averages, he takes numbers in any combinations which may suit him. And
      then he tells us that, because his tables, at the first, glance, look well
      for his theory, his theory is irrefragably proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will add a few words respecting the argument which we drew from the
      peerage. Mr. Sadler asserted that the Peers were a class condemned by
      nature to sterility. We denied this, and showed, from the last edition of
      Debrett, that the Peers of the United Kingdom have considerably more than
      the average number of children to a marriage. Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s answer
      has amused us much. He denies the accuracy of our counting, and, by
      reckoning all the Scotch and Irish Peers as Peers of the United Kingdom,
      certainly makes very different numbers from those which we gave. A member
      of the Parliament of the United Kingdom might have been expected, we
      think, to <span class="pagenum">299</span><a name="link299" id="link299"></a>know
      Letter what a Peer of the United Kingdom is.
    </p>
    <p>
      By taking the Scotch and Irish Peers, Mr. Sadler has altered the average.
      But it is considerably higher than the average fecundity of England, and
      still, therefore, constitutes an unanswerable argument against his theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shifts to which, in this difficulty, he has recourse, are exceedingly
      diverting. &ldquo;The average fecundity of the marriages of Peers,&rdquo;
      said we, &ldquo;is higher by one-fifth than the average fecundity of
      marriages throughout the kingdom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, or by whom did the Reviewer find it supposed,&rdquo; answers
      Mr. Sadler, &ldquo;that the registered baptisms expressed the full
      fecundity of the marriages of England?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuredly, if the registers of England are so defective as to explain the
      difference which, on our calculation, exists between the fecundity of the
      peers and the fecundity of the people, no argument against Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s
      theory can be drawn from that difference. But what becomes of all the
      other arguments which Mr. Sadler has founded on these very registers?
      Above all, what becomes of his comparison between the censuses of England
      and France? In the pamphlet before us, he dwells with great complacency on
      a coincidence which seems to him to support his theory, and which to us
      seems, of itself, sufficient to overthrow it.

      &ldquo;<i>In my table of the population of France, in the forty-four
      departments in which there, are from one to two hectares to each

      the results of the three computations relating to different periods given
      in my table, is 406.7. In the twenty-two counties of England, in which

    <p>
      Does not Mr. Sadler see that, if the registers of England, which are
      notoriously very defective, give a result exactly corresponding almost to
      an unit with that obtained from the registers of France, which are
      notoriously very full and accurate, this proves the very reverse of what
      he employs it to prove? The correspondence of the registers proves that
      there is no correspondence in the facts. In order to l&rsquo;aise the
      average fecundity of England even to the level of the average fecundity of
      the peers of the three kingdoms, which is 3.81 to a marriage, it is
      necessary to add nearly six per cent, to the number of births given in the
      English registers. But, if this addition be made, we shall have, in the
      counties of England, from Huntingdonshire to Worcestershire inclusive,
      4.30 births to a marriage or thereabouts; and the boasted coincidence
      between the phenomena of propagation in France and England disappears at
      once. This is a curious specimen of Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s proficiency in the
      art of making excuses. In the same pamphlet he reasons as if the same
      registers were accurate to one in a thousand, and as if they were wrong at
      the very least by one in eighteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tries to show that we have not taken a fair criterion of the fecundity
      of the peers. We are not quite sure that we understand his reasoning on
      this subject. The order of his observations is more than usually confused,
      and the cloud of words moi-e than usually <span class="pagenum">301</span><a
      name="link301" id="link301"></a>thick. We will give the argument on which
      he seems to lay most stress in his own words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>But I shall first notice a far more obvious and important Linn
      der into which the Reviewer has fallen; or into which, I rather fear, he
      knowingly wishes to precipitate his readers, since I have distinctly
      pointed ont what ought to have preserved him from it in the very chapter
      he is criticising and contradicting It is this:&mdash;he has entirely
      omitted &ldquo;counting&rdquo; the sterile marriages of all those peerages
      which have become extinct during the very period his counting embraces he
      counts, for instance, Bar. Fitzwilliam, his marriages, and heir; but has
      he not omitted to enumerate the marriages of those branches of the same
      noble house, which have become extinct since that venerable individual
      possessed his title? He talks of my having appealed merely to the
      extinction of peerages in my argument; but, on his plan of computation,
      extinctions are perpetually and wholly lost sight of. In computing the
      average! prolificness of the marriages of the nobles, he positively counts
      from a select class of them only, one from which the unprolific are
      constantly weeded, and regularly disappear; and he thus comes to the
      conclusion, that the peers are &lsquo;an eminently prolific class!&rsquo;
      Just as though a farmer should compute the rate of increase, not from the
      quantity of seed sown, but from that part of it only which comes to
      perfection, entirely omitting all which had failed to spring up or come to
      maturity. Upon this principle the most scanty crop ever obtained, in which
      the husbandman should fail to receive &lsquo;seed again,&rsquo; as the
      phrase is, might be so &lsquo;counted as to appear &lsquo;eminently
      prolific&rsquo; indeed</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If we understand this passage rightly, it decisively proves that Mr.
      Sadler is incompetent to perform even the lowest offices of statistical
      research. What shadow of reason is there to believe that the peers who
      were alive in the year 1828 differed as to their prolificness from any
      other equally numerous set of peers taken at random? In what sense were
      the peers who were alive in 1828 analogous to that part of the seed which
      comes to perfection? Did we entirely omit all that failed? On the
      contrary, we counted the sterile as <span class="pagenum">302</span><a
      name="link302" id="link302"></a>well as the fruitful marriages of all the
      peers of the United Kingdom living at one time. In what way were the peers
      who were alive in 1828 a select class? In what way were the sterile weeded
      from among them? Did every peer who had been married without having issue
      die in 1827? What shadow of reason is there to suppose that there was not
      the ordinary proportion of barren marriages among the marriages contracted
      by the noblemen whose names are in Debrett&rsquo;s last edition? But we
      ought, says Mr. Sadler, to have counted all the sterile marriages of all
      the peers &ldquo;whose titles had become extinct during the period which
      our counting embraced;&rdquo; that is to say, since the earliest marriage
      contracted by any peer living in 1828. Was such a proposition ever heard
      of before? Surely we were bound to do no such thing, unless at the same
      time we had counted also the children born from all the fruitful marriages
      contracted by peers during the same period. Mr. Sadler would have us
      divide the number of children born to peers living in 1828, not by the
      number of marriages which those peers contracted, but by the number of
      marriages which those peers contracted added to a crowd of marriages
      selected, on account of their sterility, from among the noble marriages
      which have taken place during the last fifty years. Is this the way to
      obtain fair averages? We might as well require that all the noble
      marriages which during the last fifty years have produced ten children
      apiece should be added to those of the peers living in 1828. The proper
      way to ascertain whether a set of people be prolific or sterile is, not to
      take marriages selected from the mass either on account of their
      fruitfulness or on account of their sterility, but to take a collection of
      marriages which <span class="pagenum">303</span><a name="link303"
      id="link303"></a>there is no reason to think either more or less fruitful
      than others. What reason is there to think that the marriages contracted
      by the peers who were alive in 1828 were more fruitful than those
      contracted by the peers who were alive in 1800 or in 1700?
    </p>
    <p>
      We will add another passage from Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s pamphlet on this
      subject. We attributed the extinction of peerages partly to the fact that
      those honours are for the most part limited to heirs male.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>This is a discovery indeed!&rsquo; Peeresses, &lsquo;eminently
      prolific, do not, as Macbeth conjured his spouse, &lsquo;bring forth
      men-children only;&rsquo; they actually produce daughters as well as
      sons!! Why, does not the Reviewer see, that so long as the rule of nature,
      which proportions the sexes so accurately to each other, continues to
      exist, a tendency to a diminution in one sex proves, as certainly as the
      demonstration of any mathematical problem, a tendency to a diminution in
      both; but to talk of &lsquo;eminently prolific&rsquo; peeresses, and still
      maintain that the rapid extinction in peerages is owing to their not
      bearing male children exclusively, is arrant nonsense.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if there be any proposition on the face of the earth which we should
      not have expected to hear characterised as arrant nonsense, it is this,&mdash;that
      an honour limited to males alone is more likely to become extinct than an
      honour which, like the crown of England, descends indifferently to sons
      and daughters. We have heard, nay, we actually know families, in which,
      much as Mr. Sadler may marvel at it, there are daughters and no sons. Nay,
      we know many such families. We are as much inclined as Mr. Sadler to trace
      the benevolent and wise arrangements of Providence in the physical world,
      when once we are satisfied as to the facts on which we proceed. And we
      have always considered it as an arrangement deserving of the highest <span
      class="pagenum">304</span><a name="link304" id="link304"></a>admiration,
      that, though in families the number of males and females differs widely,
      yet in great collections of human beings the disparity almost disappears.
      The chance undoubtedly is, that in a thousand marriages the number of
      daughters will not very much exceed the number of sons. But the chance
      also is, that several of those marriages will produce daughters, and
      daughters only. In every generation of the peerage there are several such
      cases. When a peer whose title is limited to male heirs dies, leaving only
      daughters, his peerage must expire, unless he have, not only a collateral
      heir, but a collateral heir descended through an uninterrupted line of
      males from the first possessor of the honour. If the deceased peer was the
      first nobleman of his family, then, by the supposition, his peerage will
      become extinct. If he was the second, it will become extinct, unless he
      leaves a brother or a brother&rsquo;s son. If the second peer had a
      brother, the first peer must have had at least two sons; and this is more
      than the average number of sons to a marriage in England. When, therefore,
      it is considered how many peerages are in the first and second generation,
      it will not appear strange that extinctions should frequently take place.
      There are peerages which descend to females as well as males. But, in such
      cases, if a peer dies, leaving only daughters, the very fecundity of the
      marriage is a cause of the extinction of the peerage. If there were only
      one daughter, the honour would descend. If there are several, it falls
      into abeyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is needless to multiply words in a case so clear; and indeed it is
      needless to say anything more about Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s book. We have, if
      we do not deceive ourselves, completely exposed the calculations on <span
      class="pagenum">305</span><a name="link305" id="link305"></a>which his
      theory rests; and we do not think that we should either amuse our readers
      or serve the cause of science if we were to rebut in succession a series
      of futile charges brought in the most angry spirit against ourselves;
      ignorant imputations of ignorance, and unfair complaints of unfairness,&mdash;conveyed
      in long, dreary, declamations, so prolix that we cannot find space to
      quote them, and so confused that we cannot venture to abridge them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is much indeed in this foolish pamphlet to laugh at, from the motto
      in the first page down to some wisdom about cows in the last. One part of
      it indeed is solemn enough, we mean a certain <i>jeu d&rsquo;esprit</i> of
      Mr. Sadler&rsquo;s touching a tract of Dr. Arbuthnot&rsquo;s. This is
      indeed &ldquo;very tragical mirth,&rdquo; as Peter Quince&rsquo;s playbill
      has it; and we would not advise any person who reads for amusement to
      venture on it as long as he can procure a volume of the Statutes at Large.
      This, however, to do Mr. Sadler justice, is an exception. His witticisms,
      and his tables of figures, constitute the only parts of his work which can
      be perused with perfect gravity. His blunders are diverting, his excuses
      exquisitely comic. But his anger is the most grotesque exhibition that we
      ever saw. He foams at the mouth with the love of truth, and vindicates the
      Divine benevolence with a most edifying heartiness of hatred. On this
      subject we will give him one word of parting advice. If he raves in this
      way to ease his mind, or because he thinks that he does himself credit by
      it, or from a sense of religious duty, far be it from us to interfere. His
      peace, his reputation, and his religion are his own concern; and he, like
      the nobleman to whom his treatise is dedicated, has a right to do what he
      will with his own. But, if he has adopted his <span class="pagenum">306</span><a
      name="link306" id="link306"></a> abusive style from a notion that it would
      hurt our feelings, we must inform him that he is altogether mistaken; and
      that he would do well in future to give us his arguments, if he has any,
      and to keep his anger for those who fear it.

      CIVIL DISABILITIES OF THE JEWS.(1)
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, January 1831.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he <span
      class="pagenum">307</span><a name="link307" id="link307"></a>distinguished
      member of the House of Commons who, towards the close of the late
      Parliament, brought forward a proposition for the relief of the Jews, has
      given notice of his intention to renew it. The force of reason, in the
      last session, carried the measure through one stage, in spite of the
      opposition of power. Reason and power are now on the same side; and we
      have little doubt that they will conjointly achieve a decisive victory. In
      order to contribute our share to the success of just principles, we
      propose to pass in review, as rapidly as possible, some of the arguments,
      or phrases claiming to be arguments, which have been employed to vindicate
      a system full of absurdity and injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The constitution, it is said, is essentially Christian; and therefore to
      admit Jews to office is to destroy the constitution. Nor is the Jew
      injured by being excluded from political power. For no man has any right
      to power. A man has a right to his property; a man has a right to be
      protected from personal injury. These rights the law allows to the Jew;
      and with these rights it would be atrocious to interfere. But it is a mere
      matter of favour to admit any man to political
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) <i>Statement of the Civil Disabilities and Privations
     affecting Jews in England</i>. 8 vo. London: 1829.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">308</span><a name="link308" id="link308"></a>power;
      and no man can justly complain that he is shut out from it. We cannot but
      admire the ingenuity of this contrivance for shifting the burden of the
      proof from those to whom it properly belongs, and who would, we suspect,
      find it rather cumbersome. Surely no Christian can deny that every human
      being has a right to be allowed every gratification which produces no harm
      to others, and to be spared every mortification which produces no good to
      others. Is it not a source of mortification to a class of men that they
      are excluded from political power? If it be, they have, on Christian
      principles, a right to be freed from that mortification, unless it can be
      shown that their exclusion is necessary for the averting of some greater
      evil. The presumption is evidently in favour of toleration. It is for the
      prosecutor to make out his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange argument which we are considering would prove too much even
      for those who advance it. If no mail has a right to political power, then
      neither Jew nor Gentile has such a right. The whole foundation of
      government is taken away. But if government be taken away, the property
      and the persons of men are insecure; and it is acknowledged that men have
      a right to their property and to personal security. If it be right that
      the property of men should be protected, and if this can only be done by
      means of government, then it must be right that government should exist.
      Now there cannot be government unless some person or persons possess
      political power. Therefore it is right that some person or persons should
      possess political power. That is to say, some person or persons must have
      a right to political power.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is because men are not in the habit of considering <span class="pagenum">309</span><a
      name="link309" id="link309"></a>what the end of government is, that
      Catholic disabilities and Jewish disabilities have been suffered to exist
      so long. We hear of essentially Protestant governments and essentially
      Christian governments, words which mean just as much as essentially
      Protestant cookery, or essentially Christian horsemanship. Government
      exists for the purpose of keeping the peace, for the purpose of compelling
      us to settle our disputes by arbitration instead of settling them by
      blows, for the purpose of compelling us to supply our wants by industry
      instead of supplying them by rapine. This is the only operation for which
      the machinery of government is peculiarly adapted, the only operation
      which wise governments ever propose to themselves as their chief object.
      If there is any class of people who are not interested, or who do not
      think themselves interested, in the security of property and the
      maintenance of order, that class ought to have no share of the powers
      which exist for the purpose of securing property and maintaining order.
      But why a man should be less fit to exercise those powers because he wears
      a beard, because he does not eat ham, because he goes to the synagogue on
      Saturdays instead of going to the church on Sundays, we cannot conceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The points of difference between Christianity and Judaism have very much
      to do with a man&rsquo;s fitness to be a bishop or a rabbi. But they have
      no more to do with his fitness to be a magistrate, a legislator, or a
      minister of finance, than with his fitness to be a cobbler. Nobody has
      ever thought of compelling cobblers to make any declaration on the true
      faith of a Christian. Any man would rather have his shoes mended by a
      heretical cobbler than by a person who had subscribed all the thirty-nine
      articles, but had never handled an <span class="pagenum">310</span><a
      name="link310" id="link310"></a>awl. Men act thus, not because they are
      indifferent to religion, but because they do not see what religion has to
      do with the mending of their shoes. Yet religion has as much to do with
      the mending of shoes as with the budget and the army estimates. We have
      surely had several signal proofs within the last twenty years that a very
      good Christian may be a very bad Chancellor of the Exchequer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it would be monstrous, say the persecutors, that Jews should legislate
      for a Christian community. This is a palpable misrepresentation. What is
      proposed is, not that the Jews should legislate for a Christian community,
      but that a legislature composed of Christians and Jews should legislate
      for a community composed of Christians and Jews. On nine hundred and
      ninety-nine questions out of a thousand, on all questions of police, of
      finance, of civil and criminal law, of foreign policy, the Jew, as a Jew,
      has no interest hostile to that of the Christian, or even to that of the
      Churchman. On questions relating to the ecclesiastical establishment, the
      Jew and the Churchman may differ. But they cannot differ more widely than
      the Catholic and the Churchman, or the Independent and the Churchman. The
      principle that Churchmen ought to monopolize the whole power of the state
      would at least have an intelligible meaning. The principle that Christians
      ought to monopolize it has no meaning at all. For no question connected
      with the ecclesiastical institutions of the country can possibly come
      before Parliament, with respect to which there will not be as wide a
      difference between Christians as there can be between any Christian and
      any Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the Jews are not now excluded from political power. They possess
      it; and as long as they are <span class="pagenum">311</span><a
      name="link311" id="link311"></a>allowed to accumulate large fortunes, they
      must possess it. The distinction which is sometimes made between civil
      privileges and political power is a distinction without a difference.
      Privileges are power. Civil and political are synonymous words, the one
      derived from the Latin, the other from the Greek. Nor is this mere verbal
      quibbling. If we look for a moment at the facts of the case, we shall see
      that the things are inseparable, or rather identical.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a Jew should be a judge in a Christian country would be most
      shocking. But he may be a juryman. He may try issues of fact; and no harm
      is done. But if he should be suffered to try issues of law, there is an
      end of the constitution. He may sit in a box plainly dressed, and return
      verdicts. But that he should sit on the bench in a black gown and white
      wig, and grant new trials, would be an abomination not to be thought of
      among baptized people. The distinction is certainly most philosophical.
    </p>
    <p>
      What power in civilised society is so great as that of the creditor over
      the debtor? If we take this away from the Jew, we take away from him the
      security of his property. If we leave it to him, we leave to him a power
      more despotic by far than that of the king and all his cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be impious to let a Jew sit in Parliament. But a Jew may make
      money; and money may make members of Parliament. Gattan and Old Sarum may
      be the property of a Hebrew. An elector of Penryn will take ten pounds
      from Shylock rather than nine pounds nineteen shillings and eleven pence
      three farthings from Antonio. To this no objection is made. That a Jew
      should possess the substance of legislative power, that he should command
      eight votes on every <span class="pagenum">312</span><a
      name="link312_rdquo_________id_" id="link312_rdquo_________id_"></a>division
      as if he were the great Duke of Newcastle himself, is exactly as it should
      be. But that he should pass the bar and sit down on those mysterious
      cushions of green leather, that he should cry &ldquo;hear&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;order,&rdquo; and talk about being on his legs, and being, for one,
      free to say this and to say that, would be a profanation sufficient to
      bring ruin on the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a Jew should be privy-councillor to a Christian king would be an
      eternal disgrace to the nation. But the Jew may govern the money-market,
      and the money-market may govern the world. The minister may be in doubt as
      to his scheme of finance till he has been closeted with the Jew. A
      congress of sovereigns may be forced to summon the Jew to their
      assistance. The scrawl of the Jew on the back of a piece of paper may be
      worth more than the royal word of three kings, or the national faith of
      three new American republics. But that he should put Right Honourable
      before his name would be the most frightful of national calamities.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this way that some of our politicians reasoned about the Irish
      Catholics. The Catholics ought to have no political power. The sun of
      England is set for ever if the Catholics exercise political power. Give
      the Catholics every thing else; but keep political power from them. These
      wise men did not see that, when every thing else had been given, political
      power had been given. They continued to repeat their cuckoo song, when it
      was no longer a question whether Catholics should have political power or
      not, when a Catholic Association bearded the Parliament, when a Catholic
      agitator exercised infinitely more authority than the Lord Lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it is our duty as Christians to exclude the Jews
    </p>
    <p>
      0-10 <span class="pagenum">313</span><a name="link313" id="link313"></a>from
      political power, it must be our duty to treat them as our ancestors
      treated them, to murder them, and banish them, and rob them. For in that
      way, and in that way alone, can we really deprive them of political power.
      If we do not adopt this course, we may take away the shadow, but we must
      leave them the substance. We may do enough to pain and irritate them; but
      we shall not do enough to secure ourselves from danger, if danger really
      exists. Where wealth is, there power must inevitably be.
    </p>

      The English Jews, we are told, are not Englishmen. They are a separate
      people, living locally in this island, but living morally and politically
      in communion with their brethren who are scattered over all the world. An
      English Jew looks on a Dutch or a Portuguese Jew as his countryman, and on
      an English Christian as a stranger. This want of patriotic feeling, it is
      said, renders a Jew unfit to exercise political functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The argument has in it something plausible; but a close examination shows
      it to be quite, unsound. Even if the alleged facts are admitted, still the
      Jews are not the only people who have preferred their sect to their
      country. The feeling of patriotism, when society is in a healthful state,
      springs up, by a natural and inevitable association, in the minds of
      citizens who know that they owe all their comforts and pleasures to the
      bond which unites them in one community. But, under a partial and
      oppressive government, these associations cannot acquire that strength
      which they have in a better state of things. Men are compelled to seek
      from their party that protection which they ought to receive from their
      country, and they, by a natural consequence, transfer to their party that
      affection which they would otherwise have felt for their country. The
      <span class="pagenum">314</span><a name="link314" id="link314"></a>Huguenots
      of France called in the help of England against their Catholic kings. The
      Catholics of France called in the help of Spain against a Huguenot king.
      Would it be fair to infer, that at present the French Protestants would
      wish to see their religion made dominant by the help of a Prussian or
      English army? Surely not. And why is it that they are not willing, as they
      formerly were willing, to sacrifice the interests of their country to the
      interests of their religious persuasion? The reason is obvious: they were
      persecuted then, and are not persecuted now. The English Puritans, under
      Charles the First, prevailed on the Scotch to invade England. Do the
      Protestant Dissenters of our time wish to see the Church put down by an
      invasion of foreign Calvinists? If not, to what cause are we to attribute
      the change? Surely to this, that the Protestant Dissenters are far better
      treated now than in the seventeenth century. Some of the most illustrious
      public men that England ever produced were inclined to take refuge from
      the tyranny of Laud in North America. Was this because Presbyterians and
      Independents are incapable of loving their country? But it is idle to
      multiply instances. Nothing is so offensive to a man who knows any thing
      of history or of human nature as to hear those who exercise the powers of
      government accuse any sect of foreign attachments. If there be any
      proposition universally true in politics it is this, that foreign
      attachments are the fruit of domestic misrule. It has always been the
      trick of bigots to make their subjects miserable at home, and then to
      complain that they look for relief abroad; to divide society, and to
      wonder that it is not united; to govern as if a section of the state were
      the whole, and to censure the other sections of the state for their <span
      class="pagenum">315</span><a name="link315" id="link315"></a>want of
      patriotic spirit. If the Jews have not felt towards England like children,
      it is because she has treated them like a step-mother. There is no feeling
      which more certainly developes itself in the minds of men living under
      tolerably good government than the feeling of patriotism. Since the
      beginning of the world, there never was any nation, or any large portion
      of any nation, not cruelly oppressed, which was wholly destitute of that
      feeling. To make it therefore ground of accusation against a class of men,
      that they are not patriotic, is the most vulgar legerdemain of sophistry.
      It is the logic which the wolf employs against the lamb. It is to accuse
      the mouth of the stream of poisoning the source.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the English Jews really felt a deadly hatred to England, if the weekly
      prayer of their synagogues were that all the curses denounced by Ezekiel
      on Tyre and Egypt might fall on London, if, in their solemn feasts, they
      called down blessings on those who should dash our children to pieces on
      the stones, still, we say, their hatred to their countrymen would not be
      more intense than that which sects of Christians have often borne to each
      other. But in fact the feeling of the Jews is not such. It is precisely
      what, in the situation in which they are placed, we should expect it to
      be. They are treated far better than the French Protestants were treated
      in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, or than our Puritans were
      treated in the time of Laud. They, therefore, have no rancour against the
      government or against their countrymen. It will not be denied that they
      are far better affected to the state than the followers of Coligni or
      Vane. But they are not so well treated as the dissenting sects of
      Christians are now treated in England; and on this account, and, we <span
      class="pagenum">316</span><a name="link316" id="link316"></a>firmly
      believe, on this account alone, they have a more exclusive spirit. Till we
      have carried the experiment farther, we are not entitled to conclude that
      they cannot be made Englishmen altogether. The statesman who treats them
      as aliens, and then abuses them for not entertaining all the feelings of
      natives, is as unreasonable as the tyrant who punished their fathers for
      not making bricks without straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rulers must not be suffered thus to absolve themselves of their solemn
      responsibility. It does not lie in their mouths to say that a sect is not
      patriotic. It is their business to make it patriotic. History and reason
      clearly indicate the means. The English Jews are, as far as we can see,
      precisely what our government has made them. They are precisely what any
      sect, what any class of men, treated as they have been treated, would have
      been. If all the red-haired people in Europe had, during centuries, been
      outraged and oppressed, banished from this place, imprisoned in that,
      deprived of their money, deprived of their teeth, convicted of the most
      improbable crimes on the feeblest evidence, dragged at horses&rsquo;
      tails, hanged, tortured, burned alive, if, when manners became milder,
      they had still been subject to debasing restrictions and exposed to vulgar
      insults, locked up in particular streets in some countries, pelted and
      ducked by the rabble in others, excluded every where from magistracies and
      honours, what would be the patriotism of gentlemen with red hair? And if,
      under such circumstances, a proposition were made for admitting red-haired
      men to office, how striking a speech might an eloquent admirer of our old
      institutions deliver against so revolutionary a measure! &ldquo;These men,&rdquo;
      he might say, &ldquo;scarcely consider themselves as Englishmen. They
      think a <span class="pagenum">317</span><a name="link317" id="link317"></a>red-haired
      Frenchman or a red-haired German more closely connected with them than a
      man with brown hair born in their own parish. If a foreign sovereign
      patronises red hair, they love him better than their own native king. They
      are not Englishmen: they cannot be Englishmen: nature has forbidden it:
      experience proves it to be impossible. Right to political power they have
      none; for no man has a right to political power. Let them enjoy personal
      security; let their property be under the protection of the law. But if
      they ask for leave to exercise power over a community of which they are
      only half members, a community the constitution of which is essentially
      darkhaired, let us answer them in the words of our wise ancestors, <i>Nolumus
      leges Anglice mutari</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, it is said, the Scriptures declare that the Jews are to be restored
      to their own country; and the whole nation looks forward to that
      restoration. They are, therefore, not so deeply interested as others in
      the prosperity of England. It is not their home, but merely the place of
      their sojourn, the house of their bondage. This argument, which first
      appeared in the Times newspaper, and which has attracted a degree of
      attention proportioned not so much to its own intrinsic force as to the
      general talent with which that journal is conducted, belongs to a class of
      sophisms by which the most hateful persecutions may easily be justified.
      To charge men with practical consequences which they themselves deny is
      disingenuous in controversy; it is atrocious in government. The doctrine
      of predestination, in the opinion of many people, tends to make those who
      hold it utterly immoral. And certainly it would seem that a man who
      believes his eternal destiny to be already irrevocably fixed is likely to
      indulge his passions <span class="pagenum">318</span><a
      name="link318_rdquo_________id_" id="link318_rdquo_________id_"></a>without
      restraint and to neglect his religious duties. If he is an heir of wrath,
      his exertions must be unavailing. If he is preordained to life, they must
      be superfluous. But would it be wise to punish every man who holds the
      higher doctrines of Calvinism, as if he had actually committed all those
      crimes which we know some Antinomians to have committed? Assuredly not.
      The fact notoriously is that there are many Calvinists as moral in their
      conduct as any Arminian, and many Arminians as loose as any Calvinist.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is altogether impossible to reason from the opinions which a man
      professes to his feelings and his actions; and in fact no person is ever
      such a fool as to reason thus, except when he wants a pretext for
      persecuting his neighbours. A Christian is commanded, under the strongest
      sanctions, to be just in all his dealings. Yet to how many of the
      twenty-four millions of professing Christians in these islands would any
      man in his senses lend a thousand pounds without security? A man who
      should act, for one day, on the supposition that all the people about him
      were influenced by the religion which they professed, would find himself
      ruined before night; and no man ever does act on that supposition in any
      of the ordinary concerns of life, in borrowing, in lending, in buying, or
      in selling. But when any of our fellow-creatures are to be oppressed, the
      case is different. Then we represent those motives which we know to be so
      feeble for good as omnipotent for evil. Then we lay to the charge of our
      victims all the vices and follies to which their doctrines, however
      remotely, seem to tend. We forget that the same weakness, the same laxity,
      the same disposition to prefer the present to the future, which make men
      worse than a good religion, make them better than a bad one. <span
      class="pagenum">319</span><a name="link319" id="link319"></a>It was in
      this way that our ancestors reasoned, and that some people in our own time
      still reason, about the Catholics. A Papist believes himself bound to obey
      the pope. The pope has issued a bull deposing Queen Elizabeth. Therefore
      every Papist will treat her grace as an usurper. Therefore every Papist is
      a traitor. Therefore every Papist ought to be hanged, drawn, and
      quartered. To this logic we owe some of the most hateful laws that ever
      disgraced our history. Surely the answer lies on the surface. The Church
      of Rome may have commanded these men to treat the queen as an usurper. But
      she has commanded them to do many other things which they have never done.
      She enjoins her priests to observe strict purity. You are always taunting
      them with their licentiousness. She commands all her followers to fast
      often, to be charitable to the poor, to take no interest for money, to
      fight no duels, to see no plays. Do they obey these injunctions? If it be
      the fact that very few of them strictly observe her precepts, when her
      precepts are opposed to their passions and interests, may not loyalty, may
      not humanity, may not the love of ease, may not the fear of death, be
      sufficient to prevent them from executing those wicked orders which she
      has issued against the sovereign of England? When we know that many of
      these people do not care enough for their religion to go without beef on a
      Friday for it, why should we think that they will run the risk of being
      racked and hanged for it?
    </p>
    <p>
      People are now reasoning about the Jews as our fathers reasoned about the
      Papists. The law which is inscribed on the wails of the synagogues
      prohibits covetousness. But if we were to say that a Jew mortgagee would
      not foreclose because God had commanded <span class="pagenum">320</span><a
      name="link320" id="link320"></a>him not to covet his neighbour&rsquo;s
      house, every body would think us out of our wits. Yet it passes for an
      argument to say that a Jew will take no interest in the prosperity of the
      country in which he lives, that he will not care how bad its laws and
      police may he, how heavily it may be taxed, how often it may be conquered
      and given up to spoil, because God has promised that, by some unknown
      means, and at some undetermined time, perhaps ten thousand years hence,
      the Jews shall migrate to Palestine. Is not this the most profound
      ignorance of human nature? Do we not know that what is remote and
      indefinite affects men far less than what is near and certain? The
      argument too applies to Christians as strongly as to Jews. The Christian
      believes as well as the Jew, that at some future period the present order
      of things will come to an end. Nay, many Christians believe that the
      Messiah will shortly establish a kingdom on the earth, and reign visibly
      over all its inhabitants. Whether this doctrine be orthodox or not we
      shall not here inquire. The number of people who hold it is very much
      greater than the number of Jews residing in England. Many of those who
      hold it are distinguished by rank, wealth, and ability. It is preached
      from pulpits, both of the Scottish and of the English church. Noblemen and
      members of Parliament have written in defence of it. Now wherein does this
      doctrine differ, as far as its political tendency is concerned, from the
      doctrine of the Jews? If a Jew is unfit to legislate for us because he
      believes that he or his remote descendants will be removed to Palestine,
      can we safely open the House of Commons to a fifth-monarchy man, who
      expects that before this generation shall pass away, all the kingdoms of
      the earth will be swallowed up in one divine empire? <span class="pagenum">321</span><a
      name="link321" id="link321"></a>Does a Jew engage less eagerly than a
      Christian in any competition which the law leaves open to him? Is he less
      active and regular in his business than his neighbours? Does he furnish
      his house meanly, because he is a pilgrim and sojourner in the land? Does
      the expectation of being restored to the country of his fathers make him
      insensible to the fluctuations of the stock-exchange? Does he, in
      arranging his private affairs, ever take into the account the chance of
      his migrating to Palestine? If not, why are we to suppose that feelings
      which never influence his dealings as a merchant, or his dispositions as a
      testator, will acquire a boundless influence over him as soon as he
      becomes a magistrate or a legislator?
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another argument which we would not willingly treat with levity,
      and which yet we scarcely know how to treat seriously. Scripture, it is
      said, is full of terrible denunciations against the Jews. It is foretold
      that they are to be wanderers. Is it then right to give them a home? It is
      foretold that they are to be oppressed. Can we with propriety suffer them
      to be rulers? To admit them to the rights of citizens is manifestly to
      insult the Divine oracles.
    </p>
    <p>
      We allow that to falsify a prophecy inspired by Divine Wisdom would be a
      most atrocious crime. It is, therefore, a happy circumstance for our frail
      species, that it is a crime which no man can possibly commit. If we admit
      the Jews to seats in Parliament, we shall, by so doing, prove that the
      prophecies in question, whatever they may mean, do not mean that the Jews
      shall be excluded from Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact it is already clear that the prophecies do not bear the meaning
      put upon them by the respectable persons whom we are now answering. In
      France and <span class="pagenum">322</span><a name="link322" id="link322"></a>in
      the United States the Jews are already admitted to all the rights of
      citizens. A prophecy, therefore, which should mean that the Jews would
      never, during the course of their wanderings, he admitted to all the
      rights of citizens in the places of their sojourn, would be a false
      prophecy. This, therefore, is not the meaning of the prophecies of
      Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we protest altogether against the practice of confounding prophecy
      with precept, of setting up predictions which are often obscure against a
      morality which is always clear. If actions are to be considered as just
      and good merely because they have been predicted, what action was ever
      more laudable than that crime which our bigots are now, at the end of
      eighteen centuries, urging us to avenge on the Jews, that crime which made
      the earth shake and blotted out the sun from heaven? The same reasoning
      which is now employed to vindicate the disabilities imposed on our Hebrew
      countrymen will equally vindicate the kiss of Judas and the judgment of
      Pilate. &ldquo;The Son of man goeth, as it is written of him; but woe to
      that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed.&rdquo; And woe to those who
      in any age or in any country, disobey his benevolent commands under
      pretence of accomplishing his predictions. If this argument justifies the
      laws now existing against the Jews, it justifies equally all the cruelties
      which have ever been committed against them, the sweeping edicts of
      banishment and confiscation, the dungeon, the rack, and the slow fire. How
      can we excuse ourselves for leaving property to people who are to &ldquo;serve
      their enemies in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of
      all things;&rdquo; for giving protection to the persons of those who are
      to &ldquo;fear day and night, and to have none assurance of their <span
      class="pagenum">323</span><a name="link323" id="link323"></a>life;&rdquo;
      for not seizing on the children of a race whose &ldquo;sons and daughters
      are to be given unto another people?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We have not so learned the doctrines of Him who commanded us to love our
      neighbour as ourselves, and who, when he was called upon to explain what
      He meant by a neighbour, selected as an example a heretic and an alien.
      Last year, we remember, it was represented by a pious writer in the John
      Bull newspaper, and by some other equally fervid Christians, as a
      monstrous indecency, that the measure for the relief of the Jews should be
      brought forward In Passion week. One of these humorists ironically
      recommended that it should be read a second time on Good Friday. We should
      have had no objection; nor do we believe that the day could be
      commemorated in a more worthy manner. We know of no day fitter for
      terminating long hostilities, and repairing cruel wrongs, than the day on
      which the religion of mercy was founded. We know of no day fitter for
      blotting out from the statute-book the last traces of intolerance than the
      day on which the spirit of intolerance produced the foulest of all
      judicial murders, the day on which the list of the victims of intolerance,
      that noble list wherein Socrates and Mole are enrolled, was glorified by a
      yet greater and holier name.

      MOORE&rsquo;S LIFE OF LORD BYRON. (1)
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, June 1831.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e <span
      class="pagenum">324</span><a name="link324" id="link324"></a>have read
      this book with the greatest pleasure. Considered merely as a composition,
      it deserves to be classed among the best specimens of English prose which
      our age has produced. It contains, indeed, no single passage equal to two
      or three which we could select from the Life of Sheridan. But, as a whole,
      it is immeasurably superior to that work. The style is agreeable, clear,
      and manly, and when it rises into eloquence, rises without effort or
      ostentation. Nor is the matter inferior to the manner. It would be
      difficult to name a book which exhibits more kindness, fairness, and
      modesty. It has evidently been written, not for the purpose of showing,
      what, however, it often shows, how well its author can write, but for the
      purpose of vindicating, as far as truth will permit; the memory of a
      celebrated man who can no longer vindicate himself. Mr. Moore never
      thrusts himself between Lord Byron and the public. With the strongest
      temptations to egotism, he has said no more about himself than the subject
      absolutely required.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great part, indeed the greater part, of these volumes, consists of
      extracts from the Letters and Journals
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) <i>Letters and Journals of Lord Byron; with Notices of his
     Life</i>. By Thomas Mooke, Esq. 2 vols. 4to. London: 1830.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">325</span><a name="link325" id="link325"></a>of Lord
      Byron; and it is difficult to speak too highly of the skill which has been
      shown in the selection and arrangement. We will not say that we have not
      occasionally remarked in these two large quartos an anecdote which should
      have been omitted, a letter which should have been suppressed, a name
      which should have been concealed by asterisks, or asterisks which do not
      answer the purpose of concealing the name. But it is impossible, on a
      general survey, to deny that the task has been executed with great
      judgment and great humanity. When we consider the life which Lord Byron
      had led, his petulance, his irritability, and his communicativeness, we
      cannot but admire the dexterity with which Mr. Moore has contrived to
      exhibit so much of the character and opinions of his friend, with so
      little pain to the feelings of the living.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extracts from the journals and correspondence of Lord Byron are in the
      highest degree valuable, not merely on account of the information which
      they contain respecting the distinguished man by whom they were written,
      but on account also of their rare merit as compositions. The Letters, at
      least those which were sent from Italy, are among the best in our
      language. They are less affected than those of Pope and Walpole; they have
      more matter in them than those of Cowper. Knowing that many of them were
      not written merely for the person to whom they were directed, but were
      general epistles, meant to be read by a large circle, we expected to find
      them clever and spirited, but deficient in ease. We looked with vigilance
      for instances of stiffness in the language and awkwardness in the
      transitions. We have been agreeably disappointed; and we must confess
      that, if the epistolary style of Lord Byron was artificial, it was a <span
      class="pagenum">326</span><a name="link326" id="link326"></a>rare and
      admirable instance of that highest art which cannot be distinguished from
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the deep and painful interest which this book excites no abstract can
      give a just notion. So sad and dark a story is scarcely to be found in any
      work of fiction; and we are little disposed to envy the moralist who can
      read it without being softened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pretty fable by which the Duchess of Orleans illustrated the character
      of her son the Regent might, with little change, be applied to Byron. All
      the fairies, save one, had been bidden to his cradle. All the gossips had
      been profuse of their gifts. One had bestowed nobility, another genius, a
      third beauty. The malignant elf who had been uninvited came last, and,
      unable to reverse what her sisters had done for their favourite, had mixed
      up a curse with every blessing. In the rank of Lord Byron, in his
      understanding, in his character, in his very person, there was a strange
      union of opposite extremes. He was born to all that men covet and admire.
      But in every one of those eminent advantages which he possessed over
      others was mingled something of misery and debasement. He was sprung from
      a house, ancient indeed and noble, but degraded and impoverished by a
      series of crimes and follies which had attained a scandalous publicity.
      The kinsman whom he succeeded had died poor, and, but for merciful judges,
      would have died upon the gallows. The young peer had great intellectual
      powers; yet there was an unsound part in his mind. He had naturally a
      generous and feeling heart: but his temper was wayward and irritable. He
      had a head which statuaries loved to copy, and a foot the deformity of
      which the beggars in the streets mimicked. Distinguished <span
      class="pagenum">327</span><a name="link327" id="link327"></a>at once by
      the strength and by the weakness of his intellect, affectionate yet
      perverse, a poor lord, and a handsome cripple, he required, if ever man
      required, the firmest and the most judicious training. But, capriciously
      as nature had dealt with him, the parent to whom the office of forming his
      character was intrusted was more capricious still. She passed from
      paroxysms of rage to paroxysms of tenderness. At one time she stifled him
      with her caresses: at another time she insulted his deformity. He came
      into the world; and the world treated him as his mother had treated him,
      sometimes with fondness, sometimes with cruelty, never with justice. It
      indulged him without discrimination, and punished him without
      discrimination. He was truly a spoiled child, not merely the spoiled child
      of his parent, but the spoiled child of nature, the spoiled child of
      fortune, the spoiled child of fame, the spoiled child of society. His
      first poems were received with a contempt which, feeble as they were, they
      did not absolutely deserve. The poem which he published on his return from
      his travels was, on the other hand, extolled far above its merit. At
      twenty-four he found himself on the highest pinnacle of literary fame,
      with Scott, Wordsworth, Southey, and a crowd of other distinguished
      writers beneath his feet. There is scarcely an instance in history of so
      sudden a rise to so dizzy an eminence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every thing that could stimulate, and every thing that could gratify the
      strongest propensities of our nature, the gaze of a hundred drawing-rooms,
      the acclamations of the whole nation, the applause of applauded men, the
      love of lovely women, all this world and all the glory of it were at once
      offered to a youth to whom nature had given violent passions, and to <span
      class="pagenum">328</span><a name="link328" id="link328"></a>whom
      education had never taught to control them. He lived as many men live who
      have no similar excuse to plead for their fruits. But his countrymen and
      his countrywomen would love him and admire him. They were resolved to see
      in his excesses only the flash and outbreak of that same fiery mind which
      glowed in his poetry. He attacked religion; yet in religious circles his
      name was mentioned with fondness, and in many religious publications his
      works were censured with singular tenderness. He lampooned the Prince
      Regent; yet he could not alienate the Tories. Every thing, it seemed, was
      to be forgiven to youth, rank, and genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the reaction. Society, capricious in its indignation as it had
      been capricious in its fondness, flew into a rage with its froward and
      petted darling. He had been worshipped with an irrational idolatry. He was
      persecuted with an irrational fury. Much has been written about those
      unhappy domestic occurrences which decided the fate of his life. Yet
      nothing is, nothing ever was, positively known to the public, but this,
      that he quarrelled with his lady, and that she refused to live with him.
      There have been hints in abundance, and shrugs and shakings of the head,
      and &ldquo;Well, well, we know,&rdquo; and &ldquo;We could an if we would,&rdquo;
      and &ldquo;If we list to speak,&rdquo; and &ldquo;There be that might an
      they list.&rdquo; But we are not aware that there is before the world
      substantiated by credible, or even by tangible evidence, a single fact
      indicating that Lord Byron was more to blame than any other man who is on
      bad terms with his wife. The professional men whom Lady Byron consulted
      were undoubtedly of opinion that she ought not to live with her husband.
      But it is to be remembered <span class="pagenum">329</span><a
      name="link329" id="link329"></a>that they formed that opinion without
      hearing both sides. We do not say, we do not mean to insinuate, that Lady
      Byron was in any respect to blame. We think that those who condemn her on
      the evidence which is now before the public are as rash as those who
      condemn her husband. We will not pronounce any judgment, we cannot, even
      in our own minds, form any judgment, on a transaction which is so
      imperfectly known to us. It would have been well if, at the time of the
      separation, all those who knew as little about the matter then as we know
      about it now had shown that forbearance which, under such circumstances,
      is but common justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know no spectacle so ridiculous as the British public in one of its
      periodical fits of morality. In general, elopements, divorces, and family
      quarrels, pass with little notice. We read the scandal, talk about it for
      a day, and forget it. But once in six or seven years our virtue becomes
      outrageous. We cannot suffer the laws of religion and decency to be
      violated. We must make a stand against vice. We must teach libertines that
      the English people appreciate the importance of domestic ties. Accordingly
      some unfortunate man, in no respect more depraved than hundreds whose
      offences have been treated with lenity, is singled out as an expiatory
      sacrifice. If he has children, they are to be taken from him. If he has a
      profession, he is to be driven from it. He is cut by the higher orders,
      and hissed by the lower. He is, in truth, a sort of whipping-boy, by whose
      vicarious agonies all the other transgressors of the same class are, it is
      supposed, sufficiently chastised. We reflect, very complacently on our own
      severity, and compare with great pride the high standard of morals
      established in England with <span class="pagenum">330</span><a
      name="link330" id="link330"></a>the Parisian laxity. At length our anger
      is satiated. Our victim is ruined and heart-broken. And our virtue goes
      quietly to sleep for seven years more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear that those vices which destroy domestic happiness ought to be
      as much as possible repressed. It is equally clear that they cannot be
      repressed by penal legislation. It is therefore right and desirable that
      public opinion should be directed against them. But it should be directed
      against them uniformly, steadily, and temperately, not by sudden fits and
      starts. There should be one weight and one measure. Decimation is always
      an objectionable mode of punishment. It is the resource of judges too
      indolent and hasty to investigate facts and to discriminate nicely between
      shades of guilt. It is an irrational practice, even when adopted by
      military tribunals. When adopted by the tribunal of public opinion, it is
      infinitely more irrational. It is good that a certain portion of disgrace
      should constantly attend on certain bad actions. But it is not good that
      the offenders should merely have to stand the risks of a lottery of
      infamy, that ninety-nine out of every hundred should escape, and that the
      hundredth, perhaps the most innocent of the hundred, should pay for all.
      We remember to have seen a mob assembled in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn to hoot a
      gentleman against whom the most oppressive proceeding known to the English
      law was then in progress. He was hooted because he had been an unfaithful
      husband, as if some of the most popular men of the age, Lord Nelson for
      example, had not been unfaithful husbands. We remember a still stronger
      case. Will posterity believe that, in an age in which men whose
      gallantries were universally known, and had been legally proved, filled
      some of the highest offices in the state and in the army, <span
      class="pagenum">331</span><a name="link331" id="link331"></a>presided at
      the meetings of religious and benevolent institutions, were the delight of
      every society, and the favourites of the multitude, a crowd of moralists
      went to the theatre, in order to pelt a poor actor for disturbing the
      conjugal felicity of an alderman? What there was in the circumstances
      either of the offender or of the sufferer to vindicate the zeal of the
      audience, we could never conceive. It has never been supposed that the
      situation of an actor is peculiarly favourable to the rigid virtues, or
      that an alderman enjoys any special immunity from injuries such as that
      which on this occasion roused the anger of the public. But such is the
      justice of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these cases the punishment was excessive; but the offence was known and
      proved. The case of Lord Byron was harder. True Jedwood justice was dealt
      out to him. First came the execution, then the investigation, and last of
      all, or rather not at all, the accusation. The public, without knowing any
      thing whatever about the transactions in his family, flew into a violent
      passion with him, and proceeded to invent stories which might justify its
      anger. Ten or twenty different accounts of the separation, inconsistent
      with each other, with themselves, and with common sense, circulated at the
      same time. What evidence there might be for any one of these, the virtuous
      people who repeated them neither knew nor cared. For in fact these stories
      were not the causes, but the effects of the public indignation. They
      resembled those loathsome slanders which Lewis Goldsmith, and other abject
      libellers of the same class, were in the habit of publishing about
      Bonaparte; such as that he poisoned a girl with arsenic when he was at the
      military school, that he hired a grenadier to shoot Dessaix at Marengo,
      that <span class="pagenum">332</span><a name="link332" id="link332"></a>he
      filled St. Cloud with all the pollutions of Capre√¶. There was a time when
      anecdotes like these obtained some credence from persons who, hating the
      French emperor without knowing why, were eager to believe any thing which
      might justify their hatred. Lord Byron fared in the same way. His
      countrymen were in a bad humour with him. His writings and his character
      had lost the charm of novelty. He had been guilty of the offence which, of
      all offences, is punished most severely; he had been over-praised; he had
      excited too warm an interest; and the public, with its usual justice,
      chastised him for its own folly. The attachments of the multitude bear no
      small resemblance to those of the wanton enchantress in the Arabian Tales,
      who, when the forty days of her fondness were over, was not content with
      dismissing her lovers, but condemned them to expiate, in loathsome shapes,
      and under cruel penances, the crime of having once pleased her too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The obloquy which Byron had to endure was such as might well have shaken a
      more constant mind. The newspapers were filled with lampoons. The theatres
      shook with execrations. He was excluded from circles where he had lately
      been the observed of all observers. All those creeping things that riot in
      the decay of nobler natures hastened to their repast; and they were right;
      they did after their kind. It is not every day that the savage envy of
      aspiring dunces is gratified by the agonies of such a spirit, and the
      degradation of such a name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy man left his country for ever. The howl of contumely followed
      him across the sea, up the Rhine, over the Alps; it gradually waxed
      fainter; it died away; those who had raised it began to ask each <span
      class="pagenum">333</span><a name="link333" id="link333"></a>other, what,
      after all, was the matter about which they had been so clamorous, and
      wished to invite back the criminal whom they had just chased from them.
      His poetry became more popular than it had ever been; and his complaints
      were read with tears by thousands and tens of thousands who had never seen
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had fixed his home on the shores of the Adriatic, in the most
      picturesque and interesting of cities, beneath the brightest of skies, and
      by the brightest of seas. Censoriousness was not the vice of the
      neighbours whom he had chosen. They were a race corrupted by a bad
      government and a bad religion, long renowned for skill in the arts of
      voluptuousness, and tolerant of all the caprices of sensuality. From the
      public opinion of the country of his adoption, he had nothing to dread.
      With the public opinion of the country of his birth, he was at open war.
      He plunged into wild and desperate excesses, ennobled by no generous or
      tender sentiment. From his Venetian harem he sent forth volume after
      volume, full of eloquence, of wit, of pathos, of ribaldry, and of bitter
      disdain. His health sank under the effects of his intemperance. His hair
      turned grey. His food ceased to nourish him. A hectic fever withered him
      up. It seemed that his body and mind were about to perish together.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this wretched degradation he was in some measure rescued by a
      connection, culpable indeed, yet such as, if it were judged by the
      standard of morality established in the country where he lived, might be
      called virtuous. But an imagination polluted by vice, a temper embittered
      by misfortune, and a frame habituated to the fatal excitement of
      intoxication, prevented him from fully enjoying the happiness which he
      might have derived from the purest and most tranquil of his <span
      class="pagenum">334</span><a name="link334" id="link334"></a>many
      attachments. Midnight draughts of ardent spirits and Rhenish wines had
      begun to work the ruin of his fine intellect. His verse lost much of the
      energy and condensation which had distinguished it. But he would not
      resign, without a struggle, the empire which he had exercised over the men
      of his generation. A new dream of ambition arose before him; to be the
      chief of a literary party; to be the great mover of an intellectual
      revolution; to guide the public mind of England from his Italian retreat,
      as Voltaire had guided the public mind of France from the villa of Ferney.
      With this hope, as it should seem, he established the Liberal. But,
      powerfully as he had affected the imaginations of his contemporaries, he
      mistook his own powers if he hoped to direct their opinions; and he still
      more grossly mistook his own disposition, if he thought that he could long
      act in concert with other men of letters. The plan failed, and failed
      ignominiously. Angry with himself, angry with his coadjutors, he
      relinquished it, and turned to another project, the last and noblest of
      his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      A nation, once the first among the nations, preeminent in knowledge,
      preeminent in military glory, the cradle of philosophy, of eloquence, and
      of the fine arts, had been for ages bowed down under a cruel yoke. All the
      vices which oppression generates, the abject vices which it generates in
      those who submit to it, the ferocious vices which it generates in those
      who struggle against it, had deformed the character of that miserable
      race. The valour which had won the great battle of human civilisation,
      which had saved Europe, which had subjugated Asia, lingered only among
      pirates and robbers. The ingenuity, once so conspicuously displayed in
      every department of physical and moral science, had <span class="pagenum">335</span><a
      name="link335" id="link335"></a>been depraved into a timid and servile
      cunning. On a sudden this degraded people had risen on their oppressors.
      Discountenanced or betrayed by the surrounding potentates, they had found
      in themselves something of that which might well supply the place of all
      foreign assistance, something of the energy of their fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a man of letters, Lord Byron conld not but be interested in the event
      of this contest. His political opinions, though, like all his opinions,
      unsettled, leaned strongly towards the side of liberty. He bad assisted
      the Italian insurgents with his purse, and, if their struggle against the
      Austrian government had been prolonged, would probably have assisted them
      with his sword. But to Greece he was attached by peculiar ties. He had
      when young resided in that country. Much of his most splendid and popular
      poetry had been inspired by its scenery and by its history. Sick of
      inaction, degraded in his own eyes by his private vices and by his
      literary failures, pining for untried excitement and honourable
      distinction, he carried his exhausted body and his wounded spirit to the
      Grecian camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      His conduct in his new situation showed so much vigour and good sense as
      to justify us in believing that, if his life had been prolonged, he might
      have distinguished himself as a soldier and a politician. But pleasure and
      sorrow had done the work of seventy years upon his delicate frame. The
      hand of death was upon him: he knew it; and the only wish which he uttered
      was that he might die sword in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was denied to him. Anxiety, exertion, exposure, and those fatal
      stimulants which had become indispensable to him, soon stretched him on a
      sick bed, in a strange land, amidst strange faces, without one human <span
      class="pagenum">336</span><a name="link336" id="link336"></a>being that he
      loved near him. There, at thirty-six, the most celebrated Englishman of
      the nineteenth century closed his brilliant and miserable career.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot even now retrace those events without feeling something of what
      was felt by the nation, when it was first known that the grave had closed
      over so much sorrow and so much glory; something of what was felt by those
      who saw the hearse, with its long train of coaches, turn slowly northward,
      leaving behind it that cemetery which had been consecrated by the dust of
      so many great poets, but of which the doors were closed against all that
      remained of Byron. We well remember that on that day, rigid moralists
      could not refrain from weeping for one so young, so illustrious, so
      unhappy, gifted with such rare gifts, and tried by such strong
      temptations. It is unnecessary to make any reflections. The history
      carries its moral with it. Our age has indeed been fruitful of warnings to
      the eminent, and of consolations to the obscure. Two men have died within
      our recollection, who, at a time of life at which many people have hardly
      completed their education, had raised themselves, each in his own
      department, to the height of glory. One of them died at Longwood; the
      other at Missolonghi.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is always difficult to separate the literary character of a man who
      lives in our own time from his personal character. It is peculiarly
      difficult to make this separation in the case of Lord Byron. For it is
      scarcely too much to say, that Lord Byron never wrote without some
      reference, direct or indirect, to himself. The interest excited by the
      events of his life mingles itself in our minds, and probably in the minds
      of almost all our readers, with the interest which properly belongs to his
      works. A generation must pass away before it will be <span class="pagenum">337</span><a
      name="link337" id="link337"></a>possible to form a fair judgment of his
      books, considered merely as books. At present they are not only books, but
      relics. We will however venture, though with unfeigned diffidence, to
      offer some desultory remarks on his poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lot was cast in the time of a great literary revolution. That poetical
      dynasty which had dethroned the successors of Shakspeare and Spenser was,
      in its turn, dethroned by a race who represented themselves as heirs of
      the ancient line, so long dispossessed by usurpers. The real nature of
      this revolution has not, we think, been comprehended by the great majority
      of those who concurred in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherein especially does the poetry of our times differ from that of the
      last century? Ninety-nine persons out of a hundred would answer that the
      poetry of the last century was correct, but cold and mechanical, and that
      the poetry of our time, though wild and irregular, presented far more
      vivid images, and excited the passions far more strongly than that of
      Parnell, of Addison, or of Pope. In the same manner we constantly hear it
      said, that the poets of the age of Elizabeth had far more genius, but far
      less correctness, than those of the age of Anne. It seems to be taken for
      granted, that there is some incompatibility, some antithesis between
      correctness and creative power. We rather suspect that this notion arises
      merely from an abuse of words, and that it has been the parent of many of
      the fallacies which perplex the science of criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is meant by correctness in poetry? If by correctness be meant the
      conforming to rules which have their foundation in truth and in the
      principles of human nature, then correctness is only another name <span
      class="pagenum">339</span><a name="link339" id="link339"></a>for
      excellence. If by correctness be meant the conforming to rules purely
      arbitrary, correctness may be another name for dulness and absurdity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A writer who describes visible objects falsely and violates the propriety
      of character, a writer who makes the mountains &ldquo;nod their drowsy
      heads&rdquo; at night, or a dying man take leave of the world with a rant
      like that of Maximin, may be said in the high and just sense of the
      phrase, to write incorrectly. He violates the first great law of his art.
      His imitation is altogether unlike the thing imitated. The four poets who
      are most eminently free from incorrectness of this description are Homer,
      Dante, Shakspeare, and Milton. They are, therefore, in one sense, and that
      the best sense, the most correct of poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it is said that Virgil, though he had less genius than Homer, was a
      more correct writer, what sense is attached to the word correctness? Is it
      meant that the story of the √Üneid is developed more skilfully than that of
      the Odyssey? that the Roman describes the face of the external world, or
      the emotions of the mind, more accurately than the Greek? that the
      characters of Achates and Mnestheus are more nicely discriminated, and
      more consistently supported, than those of Achilles, of Nestor, and of
      Ulysses? The fact incontestably is that, for every violation of the
      fundamental laws of poetry which can be found in Homer, it would be easy
      to find twenty in Virgil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Troilus and Cressida is perhaps of all the plays of Shakspeare that which
      is commonly considered as the most incorrect. Yet it seems to us
      infinitely more correct, in the sound sense of the term, than what are
      called the most correct plays of the most correct dramatists. Compare it,
      for example, with the Iphigenie <span class="pagenum">339</span><a
      name="link339" id="link339_"></a>of Racine. We are sure that the Greeks of
      Shakspeare bear a for greater resemblance than the Greeks of Racine to the
      real Greeks who besieged Troy; and for this reason, that the Greeks ol
      Shakspeare are human beings, and the Greeks of Racine mere names, mere
      words printed in capitals at the head of paragraphs of declamation.
      Racine, it is true, would have shuddered at the thought of making a
      warrior at the siege of Troy quote Aristotle. But of what use is it to
      avoid a single anachronism, when the whole play is one anachronism, the
      sentiments and phrases of Versailles in the camp of Aulis?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sense in which we are now using the word correctness, we think that
      Sir Walter Scott, Mr. Wordsworth, Mr. Coleridge, are for more correct
      poets than those who are commonly extolled as the models of correctness,
      Pope, for example, and Addison. The single description of a moonlight
      night in Pope&rsquo;s Iliad contains more inaccuracies than can be found
      in all the Excursion. There is not a single scene in Cato, in which all
      that conduces to poetical illusion, all the propriety of character, of
      language, of situation, is not more grossly violated than in any part of
      the Lay of the last Minstrel. No man can possibly think that the Romans of
      Addison resemble the real Romans so closely as the moss-troopers of Scott
      resemble the real mosstroopers. Wat Tinlinn and William of Deloraine are
      not, it is true, persons of so much dignity as Cato. But the dignity of
      the persons represented has as little to do with the correctness of poetry
      as with the correctness of painting. We prefer a gipsy by Reynolds to his
      Majesty&rsquo;s head on a sign-post, and a Borderer by Scott to a Senator
      by Addison.
    </p>
    <p>
      In what sense, then, is the word correctness used <span class="pagenum">340</span><a
      name="link340" id="link340"></a>by those who say, with the author of the
      Pursuits of Literature, that Pope was the most correct of English Poets,
      and that next to Pope came the late Mr. Gifford? What is the nature and
      value of that correctness, the praise of which is denied to Macbeth, to
      Lear, and to Othello, and given to Hoole&rsquo;s translations and to all
      the Seatonian prize-poems? We can discover no eternal rule, no rule
      founded in reason and in the nature of things, which Shakspeare does not
      observe much more strictly than Pope. But if by correctness be meant the
      conforming to a narrow legislation which, while lenient to the <i>mala in
      se</i>, multiplies, without the shadow of a reason, the <i>mala prohibita</i>,
      if by correctness be meant a strict attention to certain ceremonious
      observances, which are no more essential to poetry than etiquette to good
      government, or than the washings of a Pharisee to devotion, then,
      assuredly, Pope may be a more correct poet than Shakspeare; and, if the
      code were a little altered, Colley Cibber might be a more correct poet
      than Pope. But it may well be doubted whether this kind of correctness be
      a merit, nay, whether it be not an absolute fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be amusing to make a digest of the irrational laws which bad
      critics have framed for the government of poets. First in celebrity and in
      absurdity stand the dramatic unities of place and time. No human being has
      ever been able to find any thing that could, even by courtesy, be called
      an argument for these unities, except that they have been deduced from the
      general practice of the Greeks. It requires no very profound examination
      to discover that the Greek dramas, often admirable as compositions, are,
      as exhibitions of human character and human life, far inferior to the
      English plays of the age of Elizabeth. <span class="pagenum">341</span><a
      name="link341" id="link341"></a>Every scholar knows that the dramatic part
      of the Athenian tragedies was at first subordinate to the lyrical part. It
      would, therefore, have been little less than a miracle if the laws of the
      Athenian stage had been found to suit plays in which there was no chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the greatest masterpieces of the dramatic art have been composed in
      direct violation of the unities, and could never have been composed if the
      unities had not been violated. It is clear, for example, that such a
      character as that of Hamlet could never have been developed within the
      limits to which Alfieri confined himself. Yet such was the reverence of
      literary men during the last century for these unities that Johnson who,
      much to his honour, took the opposite side, was, as he says, &ldquo;frightened
      at his own temerity,&rdquo; and &ldquo;afraid to stand against the
      authorities which might be produced against him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There are other rules of the same kind without end. &ldquo;Shakspeare,&rdquo;
      says Rymer, &ldquo;ought not to have made Othello black; for the hero of a
      tragedy ought always to be white.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Milton,&rdquo; says another critic, &ldquo;ought not to have taken
      Adam for his hero; for the hero of an epic poem ought always to be
      victorious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Milton,&rdquo; says another, &ldquo;ought not to have put so many
      similes into his first book; for the first book of an epic poem ought
      always to be the most unadorned. There are no similes in the first book of
      the Iliad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Milton,&rdquo; says another, &ldquo;ought not to have placed in an
      epic poem such lines as these.&rdquo; <br /><br /><span class="indent15">"&lsquo;While
      thus I called, and strayed I knew not whither.&rsquo;&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And why not? The critic is ready with a reason, a lady&rsquo;s reason.
      &ldquo;Such lines,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;are not, it must be allowed,
      unpleasing to the ear; but the redundant <span class="pagenum">342</span><a
      name="link342_rdquo_________id_" id="link342_rdquo_________id_"></a>syllable
      ought to be confined to the drama, and not admitted into epic poetry.&rdquo;
      As to the redundant syllable in heroic rhyme on serious subjects, it has
      been, from the time of Pope downward, proscribed by the general consent of
      all the correct school. No magazine would have admitted so incorrect a
      couplet as that of Drayton; <br /><br /><span class="indent15">"As when we
      lived untouch&rsquo;d with these disgraces, <br /><span class="indent15">When
      as our kingdom was our dear embraces.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Another law of heroic rhyme, which, fifty years ago, was considered as
      fundamental, was, that there should be a pause, a comma at least, at the
      end of every couplet. It was also provided that there should never be a
      full stop except at the end of a line. Well do we remember to have heard a
      most correct judge of poetry revile Mr. Rogers for the incorrectness of
      that most sweet and graceful passage, <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"Such
      grief was ours,&mdash;it seems but yesterday,&mdash; <br /><span
      class="indent20">When in thy prime, wishing so much to stay, <br /><span
      class="indent20">&rsquo;Twas thine, Maria, thine without a sigh <br /><span
      class="indent20">At midnight in a sister&rsquo;s arms to die. <br /><span
      class="indent20">Oh thou wert lovely; lovely was thy frame, <br /><span
      class="indent20">And pure thy spirit as from heaven it came: <br /><span
      class="indent20">And when recalled to join the blest above <br /><span
      class="indent20">Thou diedst a victim to exceeding love, <br /><span
      class="indent20">Nursing the young to health. In happier hours, <br /><span
      class="indent20">When idle Fancy wove luxuriant flowers, <br /><span
      class="indent20">Once in thy mirth thou badst me write on thee; <br /><span
      class="indent20">And now I write what thou shalt never see.&rdquo; </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>

      Sir Roger Newdigate is fairly entitled, we think, to be ranked among the
      great critics of this school. He made a law that none of the poems written
      for the prize which he established at Oxford should exceed fifty lines.
      This law seems to us to have at least as much foundation in reason as any
      of those which we <span class="pagenum">343</span><a
      name="link343_rdquo_________id_" id="link343_rdquo_________id_"></a>have
      mentioned; nay, much more, for the world, we believe, is pretty well
      agreed in thinking that the shorter a prize-poem is, the better.

      We do not see why we should not make a few more rules of the same kind;
      why we should not enact that the number of scenes in every act shall be
      three or some multiple of three, that the number of lines in every scene
      shall be an exact square, that the <i>dramatis personae</i> shall never be
      more or fewer than sixteen, and that, in heroic rhymes, every thirty-sixth
      line shall have twelve syllables. If we were to lay down these canons, and
      to call Pope, Goldsmith, and Addison incorrect writers for not having
      complied with our whims, we should act precisely as those critics act who
      find incorrectness in the magnificent imagery and the varied music of
      Coleridge and Shelley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The correctness which the last century prized so much resembles the
      correctness of those pictures of the garden of Eden which we see in old
      Bibles. We have an exact square, enclosed by the rivers Pison, Gihon,
      Hiddekel, and Euphrates, each with a convenient bridge in the centre,
      rectangular beds of flowers, a long canal, neatly bricked and railed in,
      the tree of knowledge, clipped like one of the limes behind the
      Tuilleries, standing in the centre of the grand alley, the snake twined
      round it, the man on the right hand, the woman on the left, and the beasts
      drawn up in an exact circle round them. In one sense the picture is
      correct enough. That is to say, the squares are correct; the circles are
      correct; the man and the woman are in a most correct line with the tree;
      and the snake forms a most correct spiral.

      But if there were a painter so gifted that he could place on the canvass
      that glorious paradise, seen by the <span class="pagenum">344</span><a
      name="link344" id="link344"></a>interior eye of him whose outward sight
      had failed with long watching and labouring for liberty and truth, if
      there were a painter who could set before us the mazes of the sapphire
      brook, the lake with its fringe of myrtles, the flowery meadows, the
      grottoes overhung by vines, the forests shining with Hesperian fruit and
      with the plumage of gorgeous birds, the massy shade of that nuptial bower
      which showered down roses on the sleeping lovers, what should we think of
      a connoisseur who should tell us that this painting, though finer than the
      absurd picture in the old Bible, was not so correct? Surely we should
      answer, It is both finer and more correct; and it is finer because it is
      more correct. It is not made up of correctly drawn diagrams; but it is a
      correct painting, a worthy representation of that which it is intended to
      represent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not in the fine arts alone that this false correctness is prized by
      narrow-minded men, by men who cannot distinguish means from ends, or what
      is accidental from what is essential. M. Jourdain admired correctness in
      fencing. &ldquo;You had no business to hit me then. You must never thrust
      in quart till you have thrust in tierce.&rdquo; M. Tomes liked correctness
      in medical practice. &ldquo;I stand up for Artemius. That he killed his
      patient is plain enough. But still he acted quite according to rule. A man
      dead is a man dead; and there is an end of the matter. But if rules are to
      be broken, there is no saying what consequences may follow.&rdquo; We have
      heard of an old German officer, who was a great admirer of correctness in
      military operations. He used to revile Bonaparte for spoiling the science
      of war, which had been carried to such exquisite perfection by Marshal
      <span class="pagenum">345</span><a name="link345" id="link345"></a>Daun.
      &ldquo;In my youth we used to march and countermarch all the summer
      without gaining or losing a square league, and then we went into winter
      quarters. And now comes an ignorant, hot-headed young man, who flies about
      from Bologne to Ulm, and from Ulm to the middle of Moravia, and fights
      battles in December. The whole system of his tactics is monstrously
      incorrect.&rdquo; The world is of opinion, in spite of critics like these,
      that the end of fencing is to hit, that the end of medicine is to cure,
      that the end of war is to conquer, and that those means are the most
      correct which best accomplish the ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      And has poetry no end, no eternal and immutable principles? Is poetry,
      like heraldry, mere matter of arbitrary regulation? The heralds tell us
      that certain scutcheons and bearings denote certain conditions, and that
      to put colours on colours, or metals on metals, is false blazonry. If all
      this were reversed, if every coat of arms in Europe were new fashioned, if
      it were decreed that or should never be placed but on argent, or argent
      but on or, that illegitimacy should be denoted by a lozenge, and widowhood
      by a bend, the new science would be just as good as the old science,
      because both the new and the old would be good for nothing. The mummery of
      Portcullis and Rouge Dragon, as it has no other value than that which
      caprice has assigned to it, may well submit to any laws which caprice may
      impose on it. But it is not so with that great imitative art, to the power
      of which all ages, the rudest and the most enlightened, bear witness.
      Since its first great masterpieces were produced, every thing that is
      changeable in this world has been changed. Civilisation has been gained,
      lost, gained again. Religions, and languages, and forms of government, and
      usages of private <span class="pagenum">346</span><a
      name="link346_rdquo_________id_" id="link346_rdquo_________id_"></a>life,
      and modes of thinking, all have undergone a succession of revolutions.
      Every thing has passed away but the great features of nature, and the
      heart of man, and the miracles of that art of which it is the office to
      reflect back the heart of man and the features of nature. Those two
      strange old poems, the wonder of ninety generations, still retain all
      their freshness. They still command the veneration of minds enriched by
      the literature of many nations and ages. They are still, even in wretched
      translations, the delight of schoolboys. Having survived ten thousand
      capricious fashions, having seen successive codes of criticism become
      obsolete, they still remain to us, immortal with the immortality of truth,
      the same when perused in the study of an English scholar, as when they
      were first chanted at the banquets of the Ionian princes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poetry is, as was said more than two thousand years ago, imitation. It is
      an art analogous in many respects to the art of painting, sculpture, and
      acting. The imitations of the painter, the sculptor, and the actor, are
      indeed, within certain limits, more perfect than those of the poet. The
      machinery which the poet employs consists merely of words; and words
      cannot, even when employed by such an artist as Homer or Dante, present to
      the mind images of visible objects quite so lively and exact as those
      which we carry away from looking on the works of the brush and the chisel.
      But, on the other hand, the range of poetry is infinitely wider than that
      of any other imitative art, or than that of all the other imitative arts
      together. The sculptor can imitate only form; the painter only form and
      colour; the actor, until the poet supplies him with words, only form,
      colour, and motion. Poetry holds the outer world in common with the other
      arts. The <span class="pagenum">347</span><a name="link347" id="link347"></a>heart
      of man is the province, of poetry, and of poetry alone. The painter, the
      sculptor, and the actor can exhibit no more of human passion and character
      than that small portion which overflows into the gesture and the face,
      always an imperfect, often a deceitful, sign of that which is within. The
      deeper and more complex parts of human nature can be exhibited by means of
      words alone. Thus the objects of the imitation of poetry are the whole
      external and the whole internal universe, the face of nature, the
      vicissitudes of fortune, man as he is in himself, man as he appears in
      society, all things which really exist, all things of which we can form an
      image in our minds by combining together parts of things which really
      exist. The domain of this Imperial art is commensurate with the
      imaginative faculty.
    </p>
    <p>
      An art essentially imitative ought not surely to be subjected to rules
      which tend to make its imitations less perfect than they otherwise would
      be; and those who obey such rules ought to be called, not correct, but
      incorrect artists. The true way to judge of the rules by which English
      poetry was governed during the last century is to look at the effects
      which they produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in 1780 that Johnson completed his Lives of the Poets. He tells us
      in that work that, since the time of Dryden, English poetry had shown no
      tendency to relapse into its original savageness, that its language had
      been refined, its numbers tuned, and its sentiments improved. It may
      perhaps be doubted whether the nation had any great reason to exult in the
      refinements and improvements which gave it Douglas for Othello, and the
      Triumphs of Temper for the Fairy Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during the thirty years which preceded the <span class="pagenum">348</span><a
      name="link348" id="link348"></a>appearance of Johnson&rsquo;s Lives that
      the diction and versification of English poetry were, in the sense in
      which the word is commonly used, most correct. Those thirty years are, as
      respects poetry, the most deplorable part of our literary history. They
      have indeed bequeathed to us scarcely any poetry which deserves to be
      remembered. Two or three hundred lines of Gray, twice as many of
      Goldsmith, a few stanzas of Beattie and Collins, a few strophes of Mason,
      and a few clever prologues and satires, were the masterpieces of this age
      of consummate excellence. They may all be printed in one volume, and that
      volume would be by no means a volume of extraordinary merit. It would
      contain no poetry of the very highest class, and little which could be
      placed very high in the second class. The Paradise Regained or Comus would
      outweigh it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, when poetry had fallen into such utter decay that Mr. Hayley was
      thought a great poet, it began to appear that the excess of the evil was
      about to work the cure. Men became tired of an insipid conformity to a
      standard which derived no authority from nature or reason. A shallow
      criticism had taught them to ascribe a superstitious value to the spurious
      correctness of poetasters. A deeper criticism brought them back to the
      true correctness of the first great masters. The eternal laws of poetry
      regained their power, and the temporary fashions which had superseded
      those laws went after the wig of Lovelace and the hoop of Clarissa.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in a cold and barren season that the seeds of that rich harvest
      which we have reaped were first sown. While poetry was every year becoming
      more feeble and more mechanical, while the monotonous versification <span
      class="pagenum">349</span><a name="link349" id="link349"></a>which Pope
      had introduced, no longer redeemed by his brilliant wit and his
      compactness of expression, palled on the ear of the public, the great
      works of the old masters were every day attracting more and more of the
      admiration which they deserved. The plays of Shakspeare were better acted,
      better edited, and better known than they had ever been. Our fine ancient
      ballads were again read with pleasure, and it became a fashion to imitate
      them. Many of the imitations were altogether contemptible. But they showed
      that men had at least begun to admire the excellence which they could not
      rival. A literary revolution was evidently at hand. There was a ferment in
      the minds of men, a vague craving for something new, a disposition to hail
      with delight any thing which might at first sight wear the appearance of
      originality. A reforming age is always fertile of impostors. The same
      excited state of public feeling which produced the great separation from
      the see of Rome produced also the excesses of the Anabaptists. The same
      stir in the public mind of Europe which overthrew the abuses of the old
      French government, produced the Jacobins and Theophilanthropists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Macpherson and Della Crusca were to the true reformers of English poetry
      what Knipperdoling was to Luther, or Clootz to Turgot. The success of
      Chatterton&rsquo;s forgeries and of the far more contemptible forgeries of
      Ireland showed that people had begun to love the old poetry well, though
      not wisely. The public was never more disposed to believe stories without
      evidence, and to admire books without merit. Any thing which could break
      the dull monotony of the correct school was acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forerunner of the great restoration of our literature was Cowper. His
      literary career began and <span class="pagenum">350</span><a
      name="link350_rdquo_________id_" id="link350_rdquo_________id_"></a>ended
      at nearly the same time with that of Alfieri. A comparison between Alfieri
      and Cowper may, at first sight, appear as strange as that which a loyal
      Presbyterian minister is said to have made in 1745 between George the
      Second and Enoch. It may seem that the gentle, shy, melancholy Calvinist,
      whose spirit had been broken by fagging at school, who had not courage to
      earn a livelihood by reading the titles of bills in the House of Lords,
      and whose favourite associates were a blind old lady and an evangelical
      divine, could have nothing in common with the haughty, ardent, and
      voluptuous nobleman, the horse-jockey, the libertine, who fought Lord
      Ligonier in Hyde Park, and robbed the Pretender of his queen. But though
      the private lives of these remarkable men present scarcely any points of
      resemblance, their literary lives bear a close analogy to each other. They
      both found poetry in its lowest state of degradation, feeble, artificial,
      and altogether nerveless. They both possessed precisely the talents which
      fitted them for the task of raising it from that deep abasement. They
      cannot, in strictness, be called great poets. They had not in any very
      high degree the creative power, <br /><br /><span class="indent25">"The
      vision and the faculty divine;&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      but they had great vigour of thought, great warmth of feeling, and what,
      in their circumstances, was above all things important, a manliness of
      taste which approached to roughness. They did not deal in mechanical
      versification and conventional phrases. They wrote concerning things the
      thought of which set their hearts on fire; and thus what they wrote, even
      when it wanted every other grace, had that inimitable grace which
      sincerity and strong passion impart to the rudest and most homely
      compositions. Each of them sought <span class="pagenum">351</span><a
      name="link351" id="link351"></a>for inspiration in a noble and affecting
      subject, fertile of images which had not yet been hackneyed. Liberty was
      the muse of Alfieri, Religion was the muse of Cowper. The same truth is
      found in their lighter pieces. They were not among those who deprecated
      the severity, or deplored the absence, of an unreal mistress in melodious
      commonplaces. Instead of raving about imaginary Chloes and Sylvias, Cowper
      wrote of Mrs. Unwin&rsquo;s knitting-needles. The only love-verses of
      Alfieri were addressed to one whom he truly and passionately loved.
      &ldquo;Tutte le rime amorose che se-guono,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;tutte
      sono per essa, e ben sue, e di lei solamente; poiche mai d&rdquo; altra
      donna per certo non canter√¥.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These great men were not free from affectation. But their affectation was
      directly opposed to the affectation which generally prevailed. Each of
      them expressed, in strong and bitter language, the contempt which he felt
      for the effeminate poetasters who were in fashion both in England and in

      Alfieri speaks with similar scorn of the tragedies of his predecessors.
      &ldquo;Mi eadevano dalle mani per la languidezza, triviality e prolissit&rsquo;i
      dei modi e del verso, senza parlare poi della snervatezza dei pensieri. Or
      perche mai questa nostra divina lingua, si maschia aneo, ed energica, e
      feroce, in boeca di Dante, dovra, ella farsi cost sbiadata ed eunuca nel

      To men thus sick of the languid manner of their <span class="pagenum">352</span><a
      name="link352" id="link352"></a>contemporaries ruggedness seemed a venial
      fault, or rather a positive merit. In their hatred of meretricious
      ornament, and of what Cowper calls &ldquo;creamy smoothness,&rdquo; they
      erred on the opposite side. Their style was too austere, their
      versification too harsh. It is not easy, however, to overrate the service
      which they rendered to literature. The intrinsic value of their poems is
      considerable. But the example which they set of mutiny against an absurd
      system was invaluable. The part which they performed was rather that of
      Moses than that of Joshua. They opened the house of bondage; but they did
      not enter the promised land.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the twenty years which followed the death of Cowper, the revolution
      in English poetry was fully consummated. None of the writers of this
      period, not even Sir Walter Scott, contributed so much to the consummation
      as Lord Byron. Yet Lord Byron contributed to it unwillingly, and with
      constant self-reproach and shame. All his tastes and inclinations led him
      to take part with the school of poetry which was going out against the
      school which was coming in. Of Pope himself he spoke with extravagant
      admiration. He did not venture directly to say that the little man of
      Twickenham was a greater poet than Shakspeare or Milton; but he hinted
      pretty clearly that he thought so. Of his contemporaries, scarcely any had
      so much of his admiration as Mr. Gifford, who, considered as a poet, was
      merely Pope, without Pope&rsquo;s wit and fancy, and whose satires are
      decidedly inferior in vigour and poignancy to the very imperfect juvenile
      performance of Lord Byron himself. He now and then praised Mr. Wordsworth
      and Mr. Coleridge, but ungraciously and without cordiality. When he
      attacked them, he brought his whole soul to the work. <span class="pagenum">353</span><a
      name="link353" id="link353"></a>Of the most elaborate of Mr. Wordsworth&rsquo;s
      poems he could find nothing to say, but that it was &ldquo;clumsy, and
      frowsy, and his aversion.&rdquo; Peter Bell excited his spleen to such a
      degree that he evoked the shades of Pope and Dryden, and demanded of them
      whether it were possible that such trash could evade contempt? In his
      heart he thought his own Pilgrimage of Harold inferior to his Imitation of
      Horace&rsquo;s Art of Poetry, la feeble echo of Pope and Johnson. This
      insipid performance he repeatedly designed to publish, and was withheld
      only by the solicitations of his friends. He has distinctly declared his
      approbation of the unities, the most absurd laws by which genius was ever
      held in servitude. In one of his works, we think in his letter to Mr.
      Bowles, he compares the poetry of the eighteenth century to the Parthenon,
      and that of the nineteenth to a Turkish mosque, and boasts that, though he
      had assisted his contemporaries in building their grotesque and barbarous
      edifice, he had never joined them in defacing the remains of a chaster and
      more graceful architecture. In another letter he compares the change which
      had recently passed on English poetry to the decay of Latin poetry after
      the Augustan age. In the time of Pope, he tells his friend, it was all
      Horace with us. It is all Claudian now.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the great old masters of the art he had no very enthusiastic
      veneration. In his letter to Mr. Bowles he uses expressions which clearly
      indicate that he preferred Pope&rsquo;s Iliad to the original. Mr. Moore
      confesses that his friend was no very fervent admirer of Shakspeare. Of
      all the poets of the first class, Lord Byron seems to have admired Dante
      and Milton most. Yet in the fourth canto of Childe Harold, he places
      Tasso, a writer not merely inferior to them, but of <span class="pagenum">354</span><a
      name="link354" id="link354"></a>quite a different order of mind, on at
      least a footing of equality with them. Mr. Hunt is, we suspect, quite
      correct in saying that Lord Byron could see little or no merit in Spenser.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Byron the critic and Byron the poet were two very different men. The
      effects of the noble writer&rsquo;s theory may indeed often be traced in
      his practice. But his disposition led him to accommodate himself to the
      literary taste of the age in which he lived; and his talents would have
      enabled him to accommodate himself to the taste of any age. Though he said
      much of his contempt for mankind, and though he boasted that amidst the
      inconstancy of fortune and of fame he was all-sufficient to himself, his
      literary career indicated nothing of that lonely and unsocial pride which
      he affected. We cannot conceive him, like Milton or Wordsworth, defying
      the criticism of his contemporaries, retorting their scorn, and labouring
      on a poem in the full assurance that it would be unpopular, and in the
      full assurance that it would be immortal. He has said, by the mouth of one
      of his heroes, in speaking of political greatness, that &ldquo;he must
      serve who fain would sway;&rdquo; and this he assigns as a reason for not
      entering into political life. He did not consider that the sway which he
      had exercised in literature had been purchased by servitude, by the
      sacrifice of his own taste to the taste of the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the creature of his age; and whenever he had lived he would have
      been the creature of his age. Under Charles the First Byron would have
      been more quaint than Donne. Under Charles the Second the rants of Byron&rsquo;s
      rhyming plays would have pitted it, boxed it, and galleried it, with those
      of any Bays or Bilboa. Under George the First the monotonous <span
      class="pagenum">355</span><a name="link355" id="link355"></a>smoothness of
      Byron&rsquo;s versification and the terseness of his expression would have
      made Pope himself envious.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was, he was the man of the last thirteen years of the eighteenth
      century, and of the first twenty-three years of the nineteenth century. He
      belonged half to the old, and half to the new school of poetry. His
      personal taste led him to the former; his thirst of praise to the latter;
      his talents were equally suited to both. His fame was a common ground on
      which the zealots of both sides, Gifford, for example, and Shelley, might
      meet. He was the representative, not of either literary party, but of both
      at once, and of their conflict, and of the victory by which that conflict
      was terminated. His poetry fills and measures the whole of the vast
      interval through which our literature has moved since the time of Johnson.
      It touches the Essay on Man at the one extremity, and the Excursion at the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several parallel instances in literary history. Voltaire, for
      example, was the connecting link between the France of Lewis the
      Fourteenth and the France of Lewis the Sixteenth, between Racine and
      Boileau on the one side, and Condorcet and Beaumarchais on the other. He,
      like Lord Byron, put himself at the head of an intellectual revolution,
      dreading it all the time, murmuring at it, sneering at it, yet choosing
      rather to move before his age in any direction than to be left behind and
      forgotten. Dryden was the connecting link between the literature of the
      age of James the First, and the literature of the age of Anne. Oromasdes
      and Arimanes fought for him. Arimanes carried him off. But his heart was
      to the last with Oromasdes. Lord Byron was, in the same manner. <span
      class="pagenum">356</span><a name="link356" id="link356"></a>the mediator
      between two generations, between two hostile poetical sects. Though always
      sneering at Mr. Wordsworth, he was yet, though perhaps unconsciously, the
      interpreter between Mr. Wordsworth and the multitude. In the Lyrical
      Ballads and the Excursion Mr. Wordsworth appeared as the high priest of a
      worship, of which nature was the idol. No poems have ever indicated a more
      exquisite perception of the beauty of the outer world, or a more
      passionate love and reverence for that beauty. Yet they were not popular;
      and it is not likely that they ever will be popular as the poetry of Sir
      Walter Scott is popular. The feeling which pervaded them was too deep for
      general sympathy. Their style was often too mysterious for general
      comprehension. They made a few esoteric disciples, and many scoffers. Lord
      Byron founded what may be called an exoteric Lake school; and all the
      readers of verse in England, we might say in Europe, hastened to sit at
      his feet. What Mr. Wordsworth had said like a recluse, Lord Byron said
      like a man of the world, with less profound feeling, but with more
      perspicuity, energy, and conciseness. We would refer our readers to the
      last two cantos of Childe Harold and to Manfred, in proof of these
      observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Byron, like Mr. Wordsworth, had nothing dramatic in his genius. He
      was indeed the reverse of a great dramatist, the very antithesis to a
      great dramatist. All his characters, Harold looking on the sky, from which
      his country and the sun are disappearing together, the Giaour, standing
      apart in the gloom of the side aisle, and casting a haggard scowl from
      under his long hood at the crucifix and the censer, Conrad leaning on his
      sword by the watch-tower, Lara smiling on the dancers, Alp gazing steadily
      on the fatal cloud <span class="pagenum">357</span><a
      name="link357_rdquo_________id_" id="link357_rdquo_________id_"></a>as it
      passes before the moon, Manfred wandering among the precipices of Berne,
      Azzo on the judgment-seat, Ugo at the bar, Lambrol frowning on the siesta
      of his daughter and Juan, Cain presenting his unacceptable offering, are
      essentially the same. The varieties are varieties merely of age,
      situation, and outward show. If ever Lord Byron attempted to exhibit men
      of a different kind, he always made them either insipid or unnatural.
      Selim is nothing. Bonnivart is nothing. Don Juan, in the first and best
      cantos, is a feeble copy of the Page in the Marriage of Figaro. Johnson,
      the man whom Juan meets in the slave-market, is a most striking failure.
      How differently would Sir Walter Scott have drawn a bluff, fearless
      Englishman, in such a situation! The portrait would have seemed to walk
      out of the canvass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sardanapalus is more coarsely drawn than any dramatic personage that we
      can remember. His heroism and his effeminacy, his contempt of death and
      his dread of a weighty helmet, his kingly resolution to be seen in the
      foremost ranks, and the anxiety with which he calls for a looking-glass,
      that he may be seen to advantage, are contrasted, it is true, with all the
      point of Juvenal. Indeed the hint of the character seems to have been
      taken from what Juvenal says of Otho: <br /><br /><span class="indent15">"Speculum
      civilis sarcina belli. <br /><span class="indent15">Nimirum summi ducis est
      occidere Galbam, <br /><span class="indent15">Et curare cutem summi
      constantia civis, <br /><span class="indent15">Bedriaci in campo spolium
      affectare l&rsquo;alati, <br /><span class="indent15">Et pressum in faciem
      digitis extendere panem.&rdquo; </span></span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      These are excellent lines in a satire. But it is not the business of the
      dramatist to exhibit characters in this sharp antithetical way. It is not
      thus that Shakspeare makes Prince Hal rise from the rake of <span
      class="pagenum">358</span><a name="link358" id="link358"></a>Eastcheap
      into the hero of Shrewsbury, and sink again into the Bike of Eastcheap. It
      is not thus that Shakspeare has exhibited the union of effeminacy and
      valour in Antony. A dramatist cannot commit a greater error than that of
      following those pointed descriptions of character in which satirists and
      historians indulge so much. It is by rejecting what is natural that
      satirists and historians produce these striking characters. Their great
      object generally is to ascribe to every man as many contradictory
      qualities as possible: and this is an object easily attained. By judicious
      selection and judicious exaggeration, the intellect and the disposition of
      any human being might be described as being made up of nothing but
      startling contrasts. If the dramatist attempts to create a being answering
      to one of these descriptions, he fails, because he reverses an imperfect
      analytical process. He produces, not a man, but a personified epigram.
      Very eminent writers have fallen into this snare. Ben Jonson has given us
      a Hermogenes, taken from the lively lines of Horace; but the inconsistency
      which is so amusing in the satire appears unnatural and disgusts us in the
      play. Sir Walter Scott has committed a far more glaring error of the same
      kind in the novel of Peveril. Admiring, as every judicious reader must
      admire, the keen and vigorous lines in which Dryden satirised the Duke of
      Buckingham, Sir Walter attempted to make a Duke of Buckingham to suit
      them, a real living Zimri; and he made, not a man, but the most grotesque
      of all monsters. A writer who should attempt to introduce into a play or a
      novel such a Wharton as the Wharton of Pope, or a Lord Hervey answering to
      Sporus, would fail in the same manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to Lord Byron; his women, like his men, <span class="pagenum">359</span><a
      name="link359" id="link359"></a>are all of one breed. Haidee is a
      half-savage and girlish Julia; Julia is a civilised and matronly Haidee.
      Leila is a wedded Zuleika, Zuleika a virgin Leila. Gulnare and Medora
      appear to have been intentionally opposed to each other. Yet the
      difference is a difference of situation only. A slight change of
      circumstances would, it should seem, have sent Gulnare to the lute of
      Medora, and armed Medora with the dagger of Gulnare.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hardly too much to say, that Lord Byron could exhibit only one man
      and only one woman, a man proud, moody, cynical, with defiance on his
      brow, and misery in his heart, a scorner of his kind, implacable in
      revenge, yet capable of deep and strong affection: a woman all softness
      and gentleness, loving to caress and to be caressed, but capable of being
      transformed by passion into a tigress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even these two characters, his only two characters, he could not exhibit
      dramatically. He exhibited them in the manner, not of Shakspeare, but of
      Clarendon. He analysed them; he made them analyse themselves; but he did
      not make them show themselves. We are told, for example, in many lines of
      great force and spirit, that the speech of Lara was bitterly sarcastic,
      that he talked little of his travels, that if he was much questioned about
      them, his answers became short, and his brow gloomy. But we have none of
      Lara&rsquo;s sarcastic speeches or short answers. It is not thus that the
      great masters of human nature have portrayed human beings. Homer never
      tells us that Nestor loved to relate long stories about his youth.
      Shakspeare never tells us that in the mind of Iago every thing that is
      beautiful and endearing was associated with some filthy and debasing idea.
      <span class="pagenum">360</span><a name="link360" id="link360"></a>It is
      curious to observe the tendency which the dialogue of Lord Byron always
      has to lose its character of a dialogue, and to become soliloquy. The
      scenes between Manfred and the Chamois-hunter, between Manfred and the
      Witch of the Alps, between Manfred and the Abbot, are instances of this
      tendency. Manfred, after a few unimportant speeches, has all the talk to
      himself. The other interlocutors are nothing more than good listeners.
      They drop an occasional question or ejaculation which sets Manfred off
      again on the inexhaustible topic of his personal feelings. If we examine
      the fine passages in Lord Byron&rsquo;s dramas, the description of Rome,
      for example, in Manfred, the description of a Venetian revel in Marino
      Faliero, the concluding invective which the old doge pronounces against
      Venice, we shall find that there is nothing dramatic in these speeches,
      that they derive none of their effect from the character or situation of
      the speaker, and that they would have been as fine, or finer, if they had
      been published as fragments of blank verse by Lord Byron. There is
      scarcely a speech in Shakspeare of which the same could be said. No
      skilful reader of the plays of Shakspeare can endure to see what are
      called the fine things taken out, under the name of &ldquo;Beauties&rdquo;
      or of &ldquo;Elegant Extracts,&rdquo; or to hear any single passage,
      &ldquo;To be or not to be,&rdquo; for example, quoted as a sample of the
      great poet. &ldquo;To be or not to be&rdquo; has merit undoubtedly as a
      composition. It would have merit if put into the mouth of a chorus. But
      its merit as a composition vanishes when compared with its merit as
      belonging to Hamlet. It is not too much to say that the great plays of
      Shakspeare would lose less by being deprived of all the passages which are
      commonly called the fine passages, than those passages <span
      class="pagenum">361</span><a name="link361" id="link361"></a>lose by being
      read separately from the play. This is perhaps the highest praise which
      can be given to a dramatist.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, it may be doubted whether there is, in all Lord Byron&rsquo;s
      plays, a single remarkable passage which owes any portion of its interest
      or effect to its connection with the characters or the action. He has
      written only one scene, as far as we can recollect, which is dramatic even
      in manner, the scene between Lucifer and Cain. The conference is animated,
      and each of the interlocutors has a fair share of it. But this scene, when
      examined, will be found to be a confirmation of our remarks. It is a
      dialogue only in form. It is a soliloquy in essence. It is in reality a
      debate carried on within one single unquiet and sceptical mind. The
      questions and the answers, the objections and the solutions, all belong to
      the same character.
    </p>
    <p>
      A writer who showed so little dramatic skill in works professedly dramatic
      was not likely to write narrative with dramatic effect. Nothing conld
      indeed be more rude and careless than the structure of his narrative
      poems. He seems to have thought, with the hero of the Rehearsal, that the
      plot was good for nothing but to bring in fine things. His two longest
      works, Childe Harold and Don Juan, have no plan whatever. Either of them
      might have been extended to any length, or cut short at any point. The
      state in which the Giaour appears illustrates the manner in which all
      Byron&rsquo;s poems were constructed. They are all, like the Giaour,
      collections of fragments; and, though there may be no empty spaces marked
      by asterisks, it is still easy to perceive, by the clumsiness of the
      joining, where the parts for the sake of which the whole was composed end
      and begin. <span class="pagenum">362</span><a name="link362" id="link362"></a>It
      was in description and meditation that Byron excelled. &ldquo;Description,&rdquo;
      as he said in Don Juan, &ldquo;was his forte.&rdquo; His manner is indeed
      peculiar, and is almost unequalled; rapid, sketchy, full of vigour; the
      selection happy; the strokes few and bold. In spite of the reverence which
      we feel for the genius of Mr. Wordsworth we cannot but think that the
      minuteness of his descriptions often diminishes their effect, He has
      accustomed himself to gaze on nature with the eye of a lover, to dwell on
      every feature, and to mark every change of aspect. Those beauties which
      strike the most negligent observer, and those which only a close attention
      discovers, are equally familiar to him and are equally prominent in his
      poetry. The proverb of old Hesiod, that half is often more than the whole,
      is eminently applicable to description. The policy of the Dutch who cut
      down most of the precious trees in the Spice Islands, in order to raise
      the value of what remained, was a policy which poets would do well to
      imitate. It was a policy which no poet understood better than Lord Byron.
      Whatever his faults might be, he was never, while his mind retained its
      vigour, accused of prolixity.
    </p>
    <p>
      His descriptions, great as was their intrinsic merit, derived their
      principal interest from the feeling which always mingled with them. He was
      himself the beginning, the middle, and the end, of all his own poetry, the
      hero of every tale, the chief object in every landscape. Harold, Lara,
      Manfred, and a crowd of other characters, were universally considered
      merely as loose incognitos of Byron; and there is every reason to believe
      that he meant them to be so considered. The wonders of the outer world,
      the Tagus, with the mighty fleets of England riding on its bosom, the
      towers of <span class="pagenum">363</span><a name="link363" id="link363"></a>Cintra
      overhanging the shaggy forest of cork-trees and willows, the glaring
      marble of Pentelicus, the banks of the Rhine, the glaciers of Clarens, the
      sweet Lake of Leman, the dell of Egeria with its summer-birds and rustling
      lizards, the shapeless ruins of Rome overgrown with ivy and wall-flowers,
      the stars, the sea, the mountains, all were mere accessaries, the
      background to one dark and melancholy figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had any writer so vast a command of the whole eloquence of scorn,
      misanthropy and despair. That Marah was never dry. No art could sweeten,
      no draughts could exhaust, its perennial waters of bitterness. Never was
      there such variety in monotony as that of Byron. From maniac laughter to
      piercing lamentation, there was not a single note of human anguish of
      which he was not master. Year after year, and month after month, he
      continued to repeat that to be wretched is the destiny of all; that to be
      eminently wretched is the destiny of the eminent; that all the desires by
      which we are cursed lead alike to misery, if they are not gratified, to
      the misery of disappointment, if they are gratified, to the misery of
      satiety. His heroes are men who have arrived by different roads at the
      same goal of despair, who are sick of life, who are at war with society,
      who are supported in their anguish only by an unconquerable pride
      resembling that of Prometheus on the rock or of Satan in the burning marl,
      who can master their agonies by the force of their will, and who, to the
      last, defy the whole power of earth and heaven. He always described
      himself as a man of the same kind with his favourite creations, as a man
      whose heart had been withered, whose capacity for happiness was gone and
      could not be restored, but whose invincible spirit dared the worst that
      could befall him here or hereafter. <span class="pagenum">364</span><a
      name="link364" id="link364"></a>How much of this morbid feeling sprang
      from an original disease of the mind, how much from real misfortune, how
      much from the nervousness of dissipation, how much was fanciful, how much
      was merely affected, it is impossible for us, and would probably have been
      impossible for the most intimate friends of Lord Byron, to decide. Whether
      there ever existed, or can ever exist, a person answering to the
      description which he gave of himself may be doubted; but that he was not
      such a person is beyond all doubt. It is ridiculous to imagine that a man
      whose mind was really imbued with scorn of his fellow-creatures would have
      published three or four books every year in order to tell them so; or that
      a man who could say with truth that he neither sought sympathy nor needed
      it would have admitted all Europe to hear his farewell to his wife, and
      his blessings on his child. In the second canto of Childe Harold, he tells
      us that he is insensible to fame and obloquy: <br /><br /><span
      class="indent15">"Ill may such contest now the spirit move, <br /><span
      class="indent15">Which heeds nor keen reproof nor partial praise.&rdquo;
      </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet we know on the best evidence that, a day or two before he published
      these lines, he was greatly, indeed childishly, elated by the compliments
      paid to his maiden speech In the House of Lords.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are far, however, from thinking that his sadness was altogether
      feigned. He was naturally a man of great sensibility; he had been ill
      educated; his feelings had been early exposed to sharp trials; he had been
      crossed in his boyish love; he had been mortified by the failure of his
      first literary efforts; he was straitened in pecuniary circumstances; he
      was unfortunate in his domestic relations; the public treated him with
      cruel injustice: his health and spirits suffered from his <span
      class="pagenum">365</span><a name="link365" id="link365"></a>dissipated
      habits of life; he was, on the whole, an unhappy man. He early discovered
      that, by parading his unhappiness before the multitude, he produced an
      immense sensation. The world gave him every encouragement to talk about
      his mental sufferings. The interest which his first confessions excited
      induced him to affect much that he did not feel; and the affectation
      probably reacted on his feelings. How far the character in which he
      exhibited himself was genuine, and how far theatrical, it would probably
      have puzzled himself to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be no doubt that this remarkable man owed the vast influence
      which he exercised over his contemporaries at least as much to his gloomy
      egotism as to the real power of his poetry. We never could very clearly
      understand how it is that egotism, so unpopular in conversation, should be
      so popular in writing; or how it is that men who affect in their
      compositions qualities and feelings which they have not, impose so much
      more easily on their contemporaries than on posterity. The interest which
      the loves of Petrarch excited in his own time, and the pitying fondness
      with which half Europe looked upon Rousseau, are well known. To readers of
      our age, the love of Petrarch seems to have been love of that kind which
      breaks no hearts, and the sufferings of Rousseau to have deserved laughter
      rather than pity, to have been partly counterfeited, and partly the
      consequences of his own perverseness and vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      What our grandchildren may think of the character of Lord Byron, as
      exhibited in his poetry, we will not pretend to guess. It is certain, that
      the interest which he excited during his life is without a parallel in
      literary history The feeling with which young readers of <span
      class="pagenum">366</span><a name="link366" id="link366"></a>poetry
      regarded him can be conceived only by those who have experienced it. To
      people who are unacquainted with real calamity, &ldquo;nothing is so
      dainty sweet as lovely melancholy.&rdquo; This faint image of sorrow has
      in all ages been considered by young gentlemen as an agreeable excitement.
      Old gentlemen and middle-aged gentlemen have so many real causes of
      sadness that they are rarely inclined &ldquo;to be as sad as night only
      for wantonness.&rdquo; Indeed they want the power almost as much as the
      inclination. We know very few persons engaged in active life who, even if
      they were to procure stools to be melancholy upon, and were to sit down
      with all the premeditation of Master Stephen, would be able to enjoy much
      of what somebody calls the &ldquo;ecstasy of woe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Among that large class of young persons whose reading is almost entirely
      confined to works of imagination, the popularity of Lord Byron was
      unbounded. They bought pictures of him; they treasured up the smallest
      relics of him; they learned his poems by heart, and did their best to
      write like him, and to look like him. Many of them practised at the glass
      in the hope of catching the curl of the upper lip, and the scowl of the
      brow, which appear in some of his portraits. A few discarded their
      neckcloths in imitation of their great leader. For some years the Minerva
      press sent forth no novel without a mysterious, unhappy, Lara-like peer.
      The number of hopeful under-graduates and medical students who became
      things of dark imaginings, on whom the freshness of the heart ceased to
      fall like dew, whose passions had consumed themselves to dust, and to whom
      the relief of tears was denied, passes all calculation. This was not the
      worst. There was created in the minds of <span class="pagenum">367</span><a
      name="link367" id="link367"></a>many of these enthusiasts a pernicious and
      absurd association between intellectual power and moral depravity. From
      the poetry of Lord Byron they drew a system of ethics, compounded of
      misanthropy and voluptuousness, a system in which the two great
      commandments were, to hate your neighbour, and to love your neighbour&rsquo;s
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      This affectation has passed away; and a few more years will destroy
      whatever yet remains of that magical potency which once belonged to the
      name of Byron. To us he is still a man, young, noble, and unhappy. To our
      children he will be merely a writer; and their impartial judgment will
      appoint his place among writers, without regard to his rank or to his
      private history. That his poetry will undergo a severe sifting, that much
      of what has been admired by his contemporaries will be rejected as
      worthless, we have little doubt. But we have as little doubt, that, after
      the closest scrutiny, there will still remain much that can only perish
      with the English language.

    <h3>
      (<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, September 1831.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>his <span
      class="pagenum">368</span><a name="link368" id="link368"></a>work has
      greatly disappointed us. Whatever faults we may have been prepared to find
      in it, we fully expected that it would be a valuable addition to English
      literature; that it would contain many curious facts, and many judicious
      remarks; that the style of the notes would be neat, clear, and precise;
      and that the typographical execution would be, as in new editions of
      classical works it ought to be, almost faultless. We are sorry to be
      obliged to say that the merits of Mr. Croker&rsquo;s performance are on a
      par with those of a certain leg of mutton on which Dr. Johnson dined,
      while travelling from London to Oxford, and which he, with characteristic
      energy, pronounced to be &ldquo;as bad as bad could be, ill fed, ill
      killed, ill kept, and ill dressed.&rdquo; This edition is ill compiled,
      ill arranged, ill written, and ill printed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in the work has astonished us so much as the ignorance or
      carelessness of Mr. Croker with respect to facts and dates. Many of his
      blunders are such as we should be surprised to hear any well educated

      misstatements into which the editor never would have fallen, if he had
      taken the slightest pains to investigate the truth of his assertions, or
      if he had even been well acquainted with the book on which he undertook to
      comment. We will give a few instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Croker tells us in a note that Derrick, who was master of the
      ceremonies at Bath, died very poor in 1760. (1) We read on; and, a few
      pages later, we find Dr. Johnson and Boswell talking of this same Derrick
      as still living and reigning, as having retrieved his character, as
      possessing so much power over his subjects at Bath, that his opposition
      might be fatal to Sheridan&rsquo;s lectures on oratory. (2) And all this
      is In 1763. The fact is, that Derrick died in 1769.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one note we read, that Sir Herbert Croft, the author of that pompous
      and foolish account of Young, which appears among the Lives of the Poets,
      died in 1805. (3) Another note in the same volume states, that this same
      Sir Herbert Croft died at Paris, after residing abroad for fifteen years,
      on the 27th of April 1816. (4) Mr. Croker informs us, that Sir William
      Forbes of Pitsligo, the author of the Life of Beattie, died in 1816. (5) A
      Sir William Forbes undoubtedly died in that year, but not the Sir William
      Forbes in question, whose death took place in 1806. It is notorious,
      indeed, that the biographer of Beattie lived just long enough to complete
      the history of his friend. Eight or nine years before the date which Mr.
      Croker has assigned for Sir William&rsquo;s death, Sir Walter Scott

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">370</span><a name="link370" id="link370"></a>lamented
      that event in the introduction to the fourth canto of Marmion. Every
      school-girl knows the lines: <br /><br /><span class="indent25">"Scarce had
      lamented Forbes paid <br /><span class="indent25">The tribute to his
      Minstrel&rsquo;s shade; <br /><span class="indent25">The tale of friendship

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In one place, we are told, that Allan Ramsay, the painter, was born in
      1709, and died in 1784; (1) in another, that he died in 1784, in the
      seventy-first year of his age. (2)
    </p>
    <p>
      In one place, Mr. Croker says, that at the commencement of the intimacy
      between Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale, in 1765, the lady was twenty-five
      years old. (3) In other places he says, that Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s
      thirty-fifth year coincided with Johnson&rsquo;s seventieth.(4) Johnson
      was born in 1709. If, therefore, Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s thirty-fifth year
      coincided with Johnson&rsquo;s seventieth, she could have been only
      twenty-one years old in 1765. This is not all. Mr. Croker, in another
      place, assigns the year 1777 as the date of the complimentary lines which
      Johnson made on Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s thirty-fifth birth-day. (5) If this
      date be correct, Mrs. Thrale must have been born in 1742, and could have
      been only twenty-three when her acquaintance with Johnson commenced. Mr.
      Croker therefore gives us three different statements as to her age. Two of
      the three must be incorrect. We will not decide between them; we will only
      say, that the reasons which Mr. Croker gives for thinking that Mrs. Thrale
      was exactly thirty-five years old when Johnson was seventy, appear to us
      utterly frivolous.

     that &ldquo;Lord Mansfield survived Johnson full ten years.&rdquo; (1)
     Lord Mansfield survived Dr. Johnson just eight years and a
     quarter.
</pre>
    <p>
      Johnson found in the Library of a French lady, whom he visited during his
      short visit to Paris, some works which he regarded with great disdain.
      &ldquo;I looked,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;into the books in the lady&rsquo;s
      closet, and, in contempt, showed them to Mr. Thrale. Prince Titi,
      Biblioth√®que des F√©es, and other books.&rdquo; (2) &ldquo;The History of
      Prince Titi,&rdquo; observes Mr. Croker, &ldquo;was said to be the
      autobiography of Frederick Prince of Wales, but was probably written by
      Ralph his secretary.&rdquo; A more absurd note never was penned. The
      history of Prince Titi, to which Mr. Croker refers, whether written by
      Prince Frederick or by Ralph, was certainly never published. If Mr. Croker
      had taken the trouble to read with attention that very passage in Park&rsquo;s
      Royal and Noble Authors which he cites as his authority, he would have
      seen that the manuscript was given up to the government. Even if this
      memoir had been printed, it is not very likely to find its way into a
      French lady&rsquo;s bookcase. And would any man in his senses speak
      contemptuously of a French lady, for having in her possession an English
      work, so curious and interesting as a Life of Prince Frederick, whether
      written by himself or by a confidential secretary, must have been? The
      history at which Johnson laughed was a very proper companion to the
      Biblioth√®que des F√©es, a fairy tale about good Prince Titi and naughty
      Prince Violent. Mr. Croker may find it in the Magasin des Enfans, the
      first French book which the little girls of England read to their
      governesses.

</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">372</span><a name="link372" id="link372"></a>Mr.
      Croker states that Mr. Henry Bate, who afterwards assumed the name of
      Dudley, was proprietor of the Morning Herald, and fought a duel with
      George Robinson Stoney, in consequence of some attacks on Lady Strathmore
      which appeared in that paper.(1) Now Mr. Bate was then connected, not with
      the Morning Herald, but with the Morning Post; and the dispute took place
      before the Morning Herald was in existence. The duel was fought in
      January, 1777. The Chronicle of the Annual Register for that year contains
      an account of the transaction, and distinctly states that Mr. Bate was
      editor of the Morning Post. The Morning Herald, as any person may see by
      looking at any number of it, was not established till some years after
      this affair. For this blunder there is, we must acknowledge, some excuse:
      for it certainly seems almost incredible to a person living in our time
      that any human being should ever have stooped to fight with a writer in
      the Morning Post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James de Duglas,&rdquo; says Mr. Croker, &ldquo;was requested by
      King Robert Bruce, in his last hours, to repair, with his heart to
      Jerusalem, land humbly to deposit it at the sepulchre of our Lord, which
      he did in 1329."(2) Now, it is well known that he did no such thing, and
      for a very sufficient reason, because he was killed by the way. Nor was it
      in 1329 that he set out. Robert Bruce died in 1329, and the expedition of
      Douglas took place in the following year, &ldquo;Quand le printems vint et
      la saison,&rdquo; says Froissart, in June, 1330, says Lord Hailes, whom
      Mr. Croker cites as the authority for his statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Croker tells us that the great Marquis of Montrose was beheaded at
      Edinburgh in 1650.(3) There is not

      a <span class="pagenum">373</span><a name="link373" id="link373"></a>forward
      boy at any school in England who does not know that the marquis was
      hanged. The account of the execution is one of the finest passages in Lord
      Clarendon&rsquo;s History. We can scarcely suppose that Mr. Croker has
      never read that passage; and yet we can scarcely suppose that any person
      who has ever perused so noble and pathetic a story can have utterly
      forgotten all its most striking circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Townshend,&rdquo; says Mr. Croker, &ldquo;was not secretary of
      state till 1720."(1) Can Mr. Croker possibly be ignorant that Lord
      Townshend was made secretary of state at the accession of George I. in
      1714, that he continued to be secretary of state till he was displaced by
      the intrigues of Sunderland and Stanhope at the close of 1710, and that he
      returned to the office of secretary of state, not in 1720, but in 1721?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Croker, indeed, is generally unfortunate in his statements respecting
      the Townshend family. He tells us that Charles Townshend, the chancellor
      of the exchequer, was &ldquo;nephew of the prime minister, and son of a
      peer who was secretary of state, and leader of the House of Lords.&rdquo;
      (2) Charles Townshend was not nephew, but grandnephew, of the Duke of
      Newcastle, not son, but grandson, of the Lord Townshend who was secretary
      of state, and leader of the House of Lords.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Burgoyne surrendered at Saratoga,&rdquo; says Mr. Croker,
      &ldquo;in March, 1778.&rdquo; (3) General Burgoyne surrendered on the 17th
      of October, 1777.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; says Mr. Croker, &ldquo;can be more unfounded than
      the assertion that Byng fell a martyr <i>to political party</i>. By a
      strange coincidence of circumstances, it happened that there was a total
      change of administration between his condemnation and his death:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) III. 52.

     (2) III. 368.

     (3) IV. 222.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">374</span><a name="link374" id="link374"></a>so that
      one party presided at his trial, and another at his execution: there can
      be no stronger proof that he was <i>not</i> a political martyr.&rdquo; (1)
      Now what will our readers think of this writer, when we assure them that
      this statement, so confidently made, respecting events so notorious, is
      absolutely untrue? One and the same administration was in office when the
      court-martial on Byng commenced its sittings, through the whole trial, at
      the condemnation, and at the execution. In the month of November, 1756,
      the Duke of Newcastle and Lord Hardwicke resigned; the Duke of Devonshire
      became first lord of the treasury, and Mr. Pitt, secretary of state. This
      administration lasted till the month of April, 1757. Byng&rsquo;s
      court-martial began to sit on the 28th of December, 1756. He was shot on
      the 14th of March, 1757. There is something at once diverting and
      provoking in the cool and authoritative manner in which Mr. Croker makes
      these random assertions. We do not suspect him of intentionally falsifying
      history. But of this high literary misdemeanour we do without hesitation
      accuse him, that he has no adequate sense of the obligation which a
      writer, who professes to relate facts, owes to the public. We accuse him
      of a negligence and an ignorance analogous to that <i>crassa negligentia,</i>
      and that <i>crassa ignorantia</i>, on which the law animadverts in
      magistrates and surgeons, even when malice and corruption are not imputed.
      We accuse him of having undertaken a work which, if not performed with
      strict accuracy, must be very much worse than useless, and of having
      performed it as if the difference between an accurate and an inaccurate
      statement was not worth the trouble of looking into the most common book
      of reference.

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">375</span><a name="link375" id="link375"></a>But we
      must proceed. These volumes contain mistakes more gross, if possible, than
      any that we have yet mentioned. Boswell has recorded some observations
      made by Johnson on the changes which had taken place in Gibbon&rsquo;s
      religious opinions. That Gibbon when a lad at Oxford turned Catholic is
      well known.

    <p>
      &ldquo;It is said,&rdquo; cried Johnson, laughing, &ldquo;that he has been
      a Mahommedan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This sarcasm,&rdquo; says the editor, &ldquo;probably alludes to
      the tenderness with which Gibbon&rsquo;s malevolence to Christianity
      induced him to treat Mahommedanism in his history.&rdquo; Now the sarcasm
      was uttered in 1770; and that part of the History of the Decline and Fall
      of the Roman Empire which relates to Mahommedanism was not published till
      1788, twelve years after the date of this conversation, and near four
      years after the death of Johnson. (1)

      &ldquo;It was in the year 1701,&rdquo; says Mr. Croker, &ldquo;that

     (1) <i>A defence of this blunder was attempted. That the
     celebrated chapters in which Gibbon has traced the progress
     of Mahommedanism were not written in 1776 could not be
     denied. But it was confidently asserted that his partiality
     to Mahommedanism appeared in his first volume. This
     assertion is untrue. No passage which can by any art be
     construed into the faintest indication of the faintest
     partiality for Mahommedanism has ever been quoted or ever
     will be quoted from the first volume of the History of the
     Decline and Fall of the Woman Empire.

     To what then, it has been asked, could Johnson allude?
     Possibly to some anecdote or some conversation of which all
     trace is lost. One conjecture may be offered, though with
     diffidence. Gibbon tells us in his memoirs, that at Oxford
     he took a fancy for studying Arabic, and was prevented from
     doing so by the remonstrances of his tutor. Soon after this,
     the young man fell in with Bossuet&rsquo;s controversial writings,
     and was speedily converted by them to the Roman Catholic
     faith. The apostasy of a gentleman commoner would of course
     be for a time the chief subject of conversation in the
     common room of Magdalene. His whim about Arabic learning
     would naturally be mentioned, and would give occasion to
     some jokes about the probability of his turning Mussulman.
     If such jokes were made, Johnson, who frequently visited
     Oxford, was very likely to hear of them.</i>

      the editor to observe a more serious inaccuracy of Mrs. Piozzi, than Mr.
      Boswell notices, when he says Johnson left her table to go and sell the
      Vicar of Wakefield for Goldsmith. Now Dr. Johnson was not acquainted with
      the Thrales till 1765, four years after the book had been published.&rdquo;
      (1) Mr. Croker, in reprehending the fancied inaccuracy of Mrs. Thrale, has
      himself shown a degree of inaccuracy, or, to speak more properly, a degree
      of ignorance, hardly credible. In the first place, Johnson became
      acquainted with the Thrales, not in 1765, but in 1764, and during the last
      weeks of 1764 dined with them every Thursday, as is written in Mrs. Piozzi&rsquo;s
      anecdotes. In the second place, Goldsmith published the Vicar of
      Wakefield, not in 1761, but in 1766. Mrs. Thrale does not pretend to
      remember the precise date of the summons which called Johnson from her
      table to the help of his friend. She says only that it was near the
      beginning of her acquaintance with Johnson, and certainly not later than
      1766. Her accuracy is therefore completely vindicated. It was probably
      after one of her Thursday dinners in 1764 that the celebrated scene of the
      landlady, the sheriff&rsquo;s officer, and the bottle of Madeira, took
      place. (2)

      The very page which contains this monstrous blunder, contains another
      blunder, if possible, more monstrous still. Sir Joseph Mawbey, a foolish
      member of Parliament, at whose speeches and whose pig-styes the wits of
      Brookes&rsquo;s were, fifty years ago, in the habit of laughing most
      unmercifully, stated, on the authority of Garrick, that Johnson, while

      Oxford, about the time of his doctor&rsquo;s degree, used some
      contemptuous expressions respecting Home&rsquo;s play and Macpherson&rsquo;s
      Ossian. &ldquo;Many men,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;many women, and many
      children, might have written Douglas.&rdquo; Mr. Croker conceives that he
      has detected an inaccuracy, and glories over poor Sir Joseph in a most
      characteristic manner. &ldquo;I have quoted this anecdote solely with the
      view of showing to how little credit hearsay anecdotes are in general
      entitled. Here is a story published by Sir Joseph Mawbey, a member of the
      House of Commons, and a person every way worthy of credit, who says he had
      it from Garrick. Now mark: Johnson&rsquo;s visit to Oxford, about the time
      of his doctor&rsquo;s degree, was in 1754, the first time he had been
      there since he left the university. But Douglas was not acted till 1750,
      and Ossian not published till 1760. All, therefore, that is new in Sir
      Joseph Mawbey&rsquo;s story is false.&rdquo; (1) Assuredly we need not go
      far to find ample proof that a member of the House of Commons may commit a
      very gross error. Now mark, say we, in the language of Mr. Croker. The
      fact is, that Johnson took his Master&rsquo;s degree in 1754 (2) and his
      Doctor&rsquo;s degree in 1775. (3) In the spring of 1776, (4) he paid a
      visit to Oxford, and at this visit a conversation respecting the works of
      Home and Macpherson might have taken place, and, in all probability, did
      take place. The only real objection to the story Mr. Croker has missed.
      Boswell states, apparently on the best authority, that as early at least
      as the year 1703, Johnson, in conversation with Blair, used the same
      expressions respecting Ossian, which Sir Joseph represents him as having
      used respecting Douglas. (5) Sir Joseph, or Garrick, confounded,

      Mr. Croker.

    <p>
      We will not multiply instances of this scandalous inaccuracy. It is clear
      that a writer who, even when warned by the text on which he is commenting,
      falls into such mistakes as these, is entitled to no confidence whatever.
      Mr. Croker has committed an error of five years with respect to the
      publication of Goldsmith&rsquo;s novel, an error of twelve years with
      respect to the publication of part of Gibbon&rsquo;s History, an error of
      twenty-one years with respect to an event in Johnson&rsquo;s life so
      important as the taking of the doctoral degree. Two of these three errors
      he has committed, while ostentatiously displaying his own accuracy, and
      correcting what he represents as the loose assertions of others. How can
      his readers take on trust his statements concerning the births, marriages,
      divorces, and deaths of a crowd of people, whose names are scarcely known
      to this generation? It is not likely that a person who is ignorant of what
      almost every body knows can know that of which almost every body is
      ignorant. We did not open this book with any wish to find blemishes in it.
      We have made no curious researches. The work itself, and a very common
      knowledge of literary and political history, have enabled us to detect the
      mistakes which we have pointed out, and many other mistakes of the same
      kind. We must say, and we say it with regret, that we do not consider the
      authority of Mr. Croker, unsupported by other evidence, as sufficient to
      justify any writer who may follow him in relating a single anecdote or in
      assigning a date to a single event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Croker shows almost as much ignorance and heedlessness in his
      criticisms as in his statements concerning <span class="pagenum">379</span><a
      name="link379" id="link379"></a>facts. Dr. Johnson said, very reasonably
      as it appears to us, that some of the satires of Juvenal are too gross for
      imitation. Mr. Croker, who, by the way, is angry with Johnson for
      defending Prior&rsquo;s tales against the charge of indecency, resents
      this aspersion on Juvenal, and indeed refuses to believe that the doctor
      can have said any thing so absurd. He probably said&mdash;some <i>passages</i>
      of them&mdash;for there are none of Juvenal&rsquo;s satires to which the
      same objection may be made as to one of Horace&rsquo;s, that it is <i>altogether</i>
      gross and licentious. (1) Surely Mr. Croker can never have read the second
      and ninth satires of Juvenal.

      Indeed the decisions of this editor on points of classical learning,
      though pronounced in a very authoritative tone, are generally such that,
      if a schoolboy under our care were to utter them, our soul assuredly
      should not spare for his crying. It is no disgrace to a gentleman who has
      been engaged during near thirty years in political life that he has
      forgotten his Greek and Latin. But he becomes justly ridiculous if, when
      no longer able to construe a plain sentence, he affects to sit in judgment
      on the most delicate questions of style and metre. From one blunder, a
      blunder which no good scholar would have made, Mr. Croker was saved, as he
      informs us, by Sir Robert Peel, who quoted a passage exactly in point from
      Horace. We heartily wish that Sir Robert, whose classical attainments are
      well known, had been more frequently consulted. Unhappily he was not
      always at his friend&rsquo;s elbow; and we have therefore a rich abundance
      of the strangest errors. Boswell has preserved a poor epigram by Johnson,
      inscribed &ldquo;Ad Lan ram parituram.&rdquo; Mr. Croker censures the poet
      for applying the word puella to a lady in

      situation, and for talking of the beauty of Lucina. &ldquo;Lucina,&rdquo;
      he says, &ldquo;was never lamed for her beauty.&rdquo; (1) If Sir Robert
      Peel had seen this note, he probably would have again refuted Mr. Croker&rsquo;s
      criticisms by an appeal to Horace. In the secular ode, Lucina is used as
      one of the names of Diana, and the beauty of Diana is extolled by all the
      most orthodox doctors of the ancient mythology, from Homer in his Odyssey,
      to Claudian in his Rape of Proserpine. In another ode, Horace describes
      Diana as the goddess who assists the &ldquo;laborantes utero paellas.&rdquo;
      But we are ashamed to detain our readers with this fourth-form learning.

      Boswell found, in his tour to the Hebrides, an inscription written by a
      Scotch minister. It runs thus: &ldquo;Joannes Macleod, &amp;c., gentis su√¶
      Philarchus, &amp;c., Flor√¶ Macdonald matrimoniali vinculo conjugatus
      turrem hanc Beganodunensem pro√¶vorum habitaculum longe vetustissimum, diu
      penitus labefactatam, anno √¶r√¶ vulgaris mdcdxxxvi. instauravit.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The
      minister,&rdquo; says Mr. Croker, &ldquo;seems to have been no
      contemptible Latinist. Is not Philarchus a very happy term to express the
      paternal and kindly authority of the head of a clan?&rdquo; (2) The
      composition of this eminent Latinist, short as it is, contains several
      words that are just as much Coptic as Latin, to say nothing of the
      incorrect structure of the sentence. The word Philarchus, even if it were
      a happy term expressing a paternal and kindly authority, would prove
      nothing for the minister&rsquo;s Latin, whatever it might prove for his
      Greek. But it is clear that the word Philarchus means, not a man who rules
      by love, but a man who loves rule. The Attic writers of the best age used

      translate [Greek], a man who acquires wisdom by means of love, or [Greek],
      a man who makes money by means of love? In fact, it requires no Bentley or
      Casaubon to perceive, that Philarchus is merely a false spelling for

      Mr. Johnson was not a first-rate Greek scholar; but he knew more Greek
      than most boys when they leave school; and no schoolboy could venture to
      use the word [Greek] in the sense which Mr. Croker ascribes to it without
      imminent danger of a flogging.

    <p>
      Mr. Croker has also given us a specimen of his skill in translating Latin.
      Johnson wrote a note in which he consulted his friend Dr. Lawrence, on the
      propriety of losing some blood. The note contains these words:&mdash;&ldquo;Si
      per te licet, imperatur nuncio Holderum ad me deducere.&rdquo; Johnson
      should rather have written &ldquo;imperatum est.&rdquo; But the meaning of
      the words is perfectly clear. &ldquo;If you say yes, the messenger has
      orders to bring Holder to me.&rdquo; Mr. Broker translates the words as
      follows: &ldquo;If you consent, pray tell the

      <span class="pagenum">382</span><a name="link382" id="link382"></a>messenger
      to bring Holder to me.&rdquo; (1) If Mr. Croker is resolved to write on
      points of classical learning, we would advise him to begin by giving an
      hour every morning to our old friend Corderius.

      Indeed we cannot open any volume of this work in any place, and turn it
      over for two minutes in any direction, without lighting on a blunder.
      Johnson, in his Life of Tickell, stated that the poem entitled The Royal
      Progress, which appears in the last volume of the Spectator, was written
      on the accession of George I. The word &ldquo;arrival&rdquo; was
      afterwards substituted for &ldquo;accession.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reader will observe,&rdquo; says Mr. Croker, &ldquo;that the
      Whig term <i>accession</i>, which might imply legality, was altered into a
      statement of the simple fact of King George&rsquo;s <i>arrival</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      (2) Now Johnson, though a bigoted Tory, was not quite such a fool as Mr.
      Croker here represents him to be. In the Life of Granville, Lord
      Lansdowne, which stands a very few pages from the Life of Tickell, mention
      is made of the accession of Anne, and of the accession of George I. The
      word arrival was used in the Life of Tickell for the simplest of all
      reasons. It was used because the subject of the poem called The Royal
      Progress was the arrival of the king, and not his accession, which took
      place near two months before his arrival.

      The editor&rsquo;s want of perspicacity is indeed very amusing. He is
      perpetually telling us that he cannot understand something in the text
      which is as plain as language can make it. &ldquo;Mattaire,&rdquo; said
      Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;wrote Latin verses from time to time, and published a
      set in his old age, which he called Senilia, in which he shows so little
      learning or taste in writing, as to make Carteret a dactyl.&rdquo; (3)

      &ldquo;The editor does not understand this objection, nor the following
      observation.&rdquo; The following observation, which Mr. Croker cannot
      understand, is simply this: &ldquo;In matters of genealogy,&rdquo; says
      Johnson, &ldquo;it is necessary to give the bare names as they are. But in
      poetry and in prose of any elegance in the writing, they require to have
      inflection given to them.&rdquo; If Mr. Croker had told Johnson that this
      was unintelligible, the doctor would probably have replied, as he replied
      on another occasion, &ldquo;I have found you a reason, sir; I am not bound
      to find you an understanding.&rdquo; Every body who knows any thing of
      Latinity knows that, in genealogical tables, Joannes Baro de Carteret, or
      Vice-comes de Carteret, may be tolerated, but that in compositions which
      pretend to elegance, Carteretus, or some other form which admits of
      inflection, ought to be used.

    <p>
      All our readers have doubtless seen the two distichs of Sir William Jones,
      respecting the division of the time of a lawyer. One of the distichs is
      translated from some old Latin lines; the other is original. The former
      runs thus: <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"Six hours to sleep, to law&rsquo;s
      grave study six, <br /><span class="indent20">Four spend in prayer, the

      to the world allot, and all to heaven.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The second couplet puzzles Mr. Croker strangely. &ldquo;Sir William,&rdquo;
      says he, &ldquo;has shortened his day to twenty-three hours, and the
      general advice of &lsquo;all to heaven,&rsquo; destroys the peculiar
      appropriation of a certain period to religious exercises.&rdquo; (1) Now,

      think that it was in human dulness to miss the meaning of the lines so
      completely. Sir William distributes twenty-three hours among various
      employments. One hour is thus left for devotion. The reader expects that
      the verse will end with &ldquo;and one to heaven.&rdquo; The whole point
      of the lines consists in the unexpected substitution of &ldquo;all&rdquo;
      for &ldquo;one.&rdquo; The conceit is wretched enough; but it is perfectly
      intelligible, and never, we will venture to say, perplexed man, woman, or
      child before.

      Poor Tom Davies, after failing in business, tried to live by his pen.
      Johnson called him &ldquo;an author generated by the corruption of a
      bookseller.&rdquo; This is a very obvious, and even a commonplace allusion
      to the famous dogma of the old physiologists. Dryden made a similar
      allusion to that dogma before Johnson was born. Mr. Croker, However, is
      unable to understand what the doctor meant. &ldquo;The expression,&rdquo;
      he says, &ldquo;seems not quite clear.&rdquo; And he proceeds to talk
      about the generation of insects, about bursting into gaudier life, and
      Heaven knows what. (1)

    <p>
      There is still a stranger instance of the editor&rsquo;s talent for
      finding out difficulty in what is perfectly plain. &ldquo;No man,&rdquo;

      &ldquo;From this too just observation,&rdquo; says Boswell, &ldquo;there

      very natural and simple language. &ldquo;That a general observation should

      not universally just, is not a little odd.&rdquo; (2)

      reflections, reflections such as the least intelligent reader is quite
      competent to make for himself, and such as no intelligent reader would
      think it worth while to utter aloud. They remind us of nothing so much as
      of those profound and interesting annotations which are penciled by

      stopping us in our progress through the most delightful narrative in the
      language, to observe that really Dr. Johnson was very rude, that he talked
      more for victory than for truth, that his taste for port wine with

      foolish in Mrs. Thrale to blame the music-master; and so forth.

      We cannot speak more favourably of the manner in which the notes are
      written than of the matter of which they consist. We find in every page
      words used in wrong senses, and constructions which violate the plainest
      rules of grammar. We have the vulgarism of &ldquo;mutual friend,&rdquo;
      for &ldquo;common friend.&rdquo; We have &ldquo;fallacy&rdquo; used as
      synonymous with &ldquo;falsehood.&rdquo; We have many such inextricable
      labyrinths of pronouns as that which follows: &ldquo;Lord Erskine was fond
      of this anecdote; he told it to the editor the first time that he had the
      honour of being in his company.&rdquo; Lastly, we have a plentiful supply
      of sentences resembling those which we subjoin. &ldquo;Markland, <i>who</i>,
      with Jortin and Thirlby, Johnson calls three contemporaries of great
      eminence.&rdquo; (1) &ldquo;Warburton himself did not feel, as Mr.

      (1) &ldquo;It was <i>him</i> that Horace Walpole called a man who never

      When we turn from the commentary of Mr. Croker to the work of our old

      edition with which we are acquainted, but mangled in the most wanton
      manner. Much that Boswell inserted in his narrative is, without the shadow
      of a reason, degraded to the appendix. The editor has also taken upon
      himself to alter or omit passages which he considers as indecorous. This
      prudery is quite unintelligible to us. There is nothing immoral in Boswell&rsquo;s
      book, nothing which tends to inflame the passions. He sometimes uses plain
      words. But if this be a taint which requires expurgation, it would be
      desirable to begin by expurgating the morning and evening lessons. The
      delicate office which Mr. Croker has undertaken he has performed in the
      most capricious manner. One strong, old-fashioned, English word, familiar
      to all who read their Bibles, is changed for a softer synonyme in some
      passages, and suffered to stand unaltered in others. In one place a faint
      allusion made by Johnson to an indelicate subject, an allusion so faint
      that, till Mr. Croker&rsquo;s note pointed it out to us, we had never
      noticed it, and of which we are quite sure that the meaning would never be
      discovered by any of those

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">387</span><a name="link387" id="link387"></a>for
      whose sake books are expurgated, is altogether omitted. In another place,
      a coarse and stupid jest of Dr. Taylor on the same subject, expressed in
      the broadest language, almost the only passage, as far as we remember, in
      all Boswell&rsquo;s book, which we should have been inclined to leave out,
      is suffered to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      We complain, however, much more of the additions than of the omissions. We
      have half of Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s book, scraps of Mr. Tyers, scraps of Mr.
      Murphy, scraps of Mr. Cradock, long prosings of Sir John Hawkins, and
      connecting observations by Mr. Croker himself, inserted into the midst of
      Boswell&rsquo;s text. To this practice we most decidedly object. An editor
      might as well publish Thucydides with extracts from Diodorus interspersed,
      or incorporate the Lives of Suetonius with the History and Annals of
      Tacitus. Mr. Croker tells us, indeed, that he has done only what Boswell
      wished to do, and was prevented from doing by the law of copyright. We
      doubt this greatly. Boswell has studiously abstained from availing himself
      of the information given by his rivals, on many occasions on which he
      might have cited them without subjecting himself to the charge of piracy.
      Mr. Croker has himself, on one occasion, remarked very justly that Boswell
      was unwilling to owe any obligation to Hawkins. But, be this as it may, if
      Boswell had quoted from Sir John and from Mrs. Thrale, he would have been
      guided by his own taste and judgment in selecting his quotations. On what
      Boswell quoted he would have commented with perfect freedom; and the
      borrowed passages, so selected, and accompanied by such comments, would
      have become original. They would have dove-tailed into the work. No hitch,
      no crease, <span class="pagenum">388</span><a name="link388" id="link388"></a>would
      have been discernible. The whole would appear one and indivisible, <br /><br /><span
      class="indent25">"Ut per l√¶ve severos <br /><span class="indent15">Effundat
      junctura ungues.&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not the case with Mr. Croker&rsquo;s insertions. They are not
      chosen as Boswell would have chosen them. They are not introduced as
      Boswell would have introduced them. They differ from the quotations
      scattered through the original Life of Johnson, as a withered bough stuck
      in the ground differs from a tree skilfully transplanted with all its life
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only do these anecdotes disfigure Boswell&rsquo;s book; they are
      themselves disfigured by being inserted in his book. The charm of Mrs.
      Thrale&rsquo;s little volume is utterly destroyed. The feminine quickness
      of observation, the feminine softness of heart, the colloquial
      incorrectness and vivacity of style, the little amusing airs of a
      half-learned lady, the delightful garrulity, the &ldquo;dear Doctor
      Johnson,&rdquo; the &ldquo;it was so comical,&rdquo; all disappear in Mr.
      Croker&rsquo;s quotations. The lady ceases to speak in the first person;
      and her anecdotes, in the process of transfusion, become as flat as
      Champagne in decanters, or Herodotus in Beloe&rsquo;s version. Sir John
      Hawkins, it is true, loses nothing; and for the best of reasons. Sir John
      had nothing to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The course which Mr. Croker ought to have taken is quite clear. He should
      have reprinted Boswell&rsquo;s narrative precisely as Boswell wrote it;
      and in the notes or the appendix he should have placed any anecdotes which
      he might have thought it advisable to quote from other writers. This would
      have been a much more convenient course for the reader, who has now
      constantly to keep his eye on the margin in order <span class="pagenum">389</span><a
      name="link389" id="link389"></a>to see whether he is perusing Boswell,
      Mrs. Thrale, Murphy, Hawkins, Tyers, Cradock, or Mr. Croker. We greatly
      doubt whether even the Tour to the Hebrides ought to have been inserted in
      the midst of the Life. There is one marked distinction between the two
      works. Most of the Tour was seen by Johnson in manuscript. It does not
      appear that he ever saw any part of the Life.
    </p>
    <p>
      We love, we own, to read the great productions of the human mind as they
      were written. We have this feeling even about scientific treatises; though
      we know that the sciences are always in a state of progression, and that
      the alterations made by a modern editor in an old book on any branch of
      natural or political philosophy are likely to be improvements. Some errors
      have been detected by writers of this generation in the speculations of
      Adam Smith. A short cut has been made to much knowledge at which Sir Isaac
      Newton arrived through arduous and circuitous paths. Yet we still look
      with peculiar veneration on the Wealth of Nations and on the Principia,
      and should regret to see either of those great works garbled even by the
      ablest hands. But in works which owe much of their interest to the
      character and situation of the writers the case is infinitely stronger.
      What man of taste and feeling can endure <i>rifacimenti</i>, harmonies,
      abridgments, expurgated editions? Who ever reads a stage-copy of a play
      when he can procure the original? Who ever cut open All&rsquo;s. Siddons&rsquo;s
      Milton? Who ever got through ten pages of Mr. Gilpin&rsquo;s translation
      of John Bun-yan&rsquo;s Pilgrim into modern English? Who would lose, in
      the confusion of a Diatessaron, the peculiar charm which belongs to the
      narrative of the disciple whom Jesus loved? The feeling of a reader who
      has become <span class="pagenum">390</span><a name="link390" id="link390"></a>intimate
      with any great original work is that which Adam expressed towards his
      bride: <br /><br /><span class="indent20">"Should God create another Eve,
      and I <br /><span class="indent20">Another rib afford, yet loss of thee
      <br /><span class="indent15">Would never from my heart.&rsquo;&rdquo;

      No substitute, however exquisitely formed, will fill the void left by the
      original. The second beauty may be equal or superior to the first; but
      still it is not she.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reasons which Mr. Croker has given for incorporating passages from Sir
      John Hawkins and Mrs. Thrale with the narrative of Boswell would vindicate
      the adulteration of half the classical works in the language. If Pepys&rsquo;s
      Diary and Mrs. Hutchinson&rsquo;s Memoirs had been published a hundred
      years ago, no human being can doubt that Mr. Hume would have made great
      use of those books in his History of England. But would it, on that
      account, be judicious in a writer of our times to publish an edition of
      Hume&rsquo;s History of England, in which large extracts from Pepys and
      Mrs. Hutchinson should be incorporated with the original text? Surely not.
      Hume&rsquo;s history, be its faults what they may, is now one great entire
      work, the production of one vigorous mind, working on such materials as
      were within its reach. Additions made by another hand may supply a
      particular deficiency, but would grievously injure the general effect.
      With Boswell&rsquo;s book the case is stronger. There is scarcely, in the
      whole compass of literature, a book which bears interpolation so ill. We
      know no production of the human mind which has so much of what may be
      called the race, so much of the peculiar flavour of the soil from which it
      sprang. The work could never have been written if the writer had not been
      precisely what he was. His character is displayed in every page, and <span
      class="pagenum">391</span><a name="link391" id="link391"></a>this display
      of character gives a delightful interest to many passages which have no
      other interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Life of Johnson is assuredly a great, a very great work. Homer is not
      more decidedly the first of heroic poets, Shakspeare is not more decidedly
      the first of dramatists, Demosthenes is not more decidedly the first of
      orators, than Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He
      has distanced all his competitors so decided that it is not worth while to
      place them. Eclipse r first, and the rest nowhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not sure that there is in the whole history of the human intellect
      so strange a ph√¶nomenon as this book. Many of the greatest men that ever
      lived have written biography. Boswell was one of the smallest men that
      ever lived, and he has beaten them all. He was, if we are to give any
      credit to his own account or to the united testimony of all who knew him,
      a man of the meanest and feeblest intellect. Johnson described him as a
      fellow who had missed his only chance of immortality by not having been
      alive when the Dunciad was written. Beauclerk used his name as a
      proverbial expression for a bore. He was the laughing stock of the whole
      of that brilliant society which has owed to him the greater part of its
      fame. He was always laying himself at the feet of some eminent man, and
      begging to be spit upon and trampled upon. He was always earning some
      ridiculous nickname, and then &ldquo;binding it as a crown unto him,&rdquo;
      not merely in metaphor, but literally. He exhibited himself, at the
      Shakspeare Jubilee, to all the crowd which filled Stratford-on-won, with a
      placard round his hat bearing the inscription of Corsica Boswell. In his
      Tour, he proclaimed to all the world that at Edinburgh he was known by the
      appellation of <span class="pagenum">392</span><a
      name="link392_rdquo_________id_" id="link392_rdquo_________id_"></a>Paoli
      Boswell. Servile and impertinent shallow and pedantic, a bigot and a sot,
      bloated with family pride, and eternally blustering about the dignity of a
      born gentleman, yet stooping to be a talebearer, an eavesdropper, a common
      butt in the taverns of London, so curious to know every body who was
      talked about, that, Tory and high Churchman as he was, he manoeuvred, we
      have been told, for an introduction to Tom Paine, so vain of the most
      childish distinctions, that when he had been to court, he drove to the
      office where his book was printing without changing his clothes, and
      summoned all the printer&rsquo;s devils to admire his new ruffles and
      sword; such was this man, and such he was contented and proud to be. Every
      thing which another man would have hidden, every thing the publication of
      which would have made another man hang himself, was matter of gay and
      clamorous exultation to his weak and diseased mind. What silly things he
      said, what bitter retorts he provoked, how at one place he was troubled
      with evil presentiments which came to nothing, how at another place, on
      waking from a drunken doze, he read the prayerbook and took a hair of the
      dog that had bitten him, how he went to see men hanged and came away
      maudlin, how he added five hundred pounds to the fortune of one of his
      babies because she was not scared at Johnson&rsquo;s ugly face, how he was
      frightened out of his wits at sea, and how the sailors quieted him as they
      would have quieted a child, how tipsy he was at Lady Cork&rsquo;s one
      evening and how much his merriment annoyed the ladies, how impertinent he
      was to the Duchess of Argyle and with what stately contempt she put down
      his impertinence, how Colonel Macleod sneered to his face at his impudent
      obtrusiveness, how his father and the very wife of his <span
      class="pagenum">393</span><a name="link393" id="link393"></a>bosom laughed
      and fretted at his fooleries; all these things he proclaimed to all the
      world, as if they had been subjects for pride and ostentations rejoicing.
      All the caprices of his temper, all the illusions of his vanity, all his
      hypochondriac whimsies, all his castles in the air, he displayed with a
      cool self-complacency, a perfect unconsciousness that he was making a fool
      of himself, to which it is impossible to find a parallel in the whole
      history of mankind. He has used many people ill; but assuredly he has used
      nobody so ill as himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      That such a man should have written one of the best books in the world is
      strange enough. But this is not all. Many persons who have conducted
      themselves foolishly in active life, and whose conversation has indicated
      no superior powers of mind, have left us valuable works. Goldsmith was
      very justly described by one of his contemporaries as an inspired idiot,
      and by another as a being <br /><br /><span class="indent15">"Who wrote like
      an angel, and talked like poor Poll.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      La Fontaine was in society a mere simpleton. His blunders would not come
      in amiss among the stories of Hierocles. But these men attained literary
      eminence in spite of their weaknesses. Boswell attained it by reason of
      his weaknesses. If he had not been a great fool, he would never have been
      a great writer. Without all the qualities which made him the jest and the
      torment of those among whom he lived, without the officiousness, the
      inquisitiveness, the effrontery, the toadeating, the insensibility to all
      reproof, he never could have produced so excellent a book. He was a slave,
      proud of his servitude, a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and
      garrulity were virtues, an unsafe companion who never scrupled to repay
      the most <span class="pagenum">394</span><a name="link394" id="link394"></a>liberal
      hospitality by the basest violation of confidence, a man without delicacy,
      without shame, without sense enough to know when he was hurting the
      feelings of others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and
      because he was all this, he has, in an important department of literature,
      immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and
      his own idol Johnson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the talents which ordinarily raise men to eminence as writers, Boswell
      had absolutely none. There is not in all his books a single remark of his
      own on literature, politics, religion, or society, which is not either
      commonplace or absurd. His dissertations on hereditary gentility, on the
      slave-trade, and on the entailing of landed estates, may serve as
      examples. To say that these passages are sophistical would be to pay them
      an extravagant compliment. They have no pretence to argument, or even to
      meaning. He has reported innumerable observations made by himself in the
      course of conversation. Of those observations we do not remember one which
      is above the intellectual capacity of a boy of fifteen. He has printed
      many of his own letters, and in these letters he is always ranting or
      twaddling. Logic, eloquence, wit, taste, all those things which are
      generally considered as making a book valuable, were utterly wanting to
      him. He had, indeed, a quick observation and a retentive memory. These
      qualities, if he had been a man of sense and virtue, would scarcely of
      themselves have sufficed to make him conspicuous; but, because he was a
      dunce, a parasite, and a coxcomb, they have made him immortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those parts of his book which, considered abstractedly, are most utterly
      worthless, are delightful when we read them as illustrations of the
      character of the <span class="pagenum">395</span><a
      name="link395_rdquo_________id_" id="link395_rdquo_________id_"></a>writer.
      Bad in themselves, they are good dramatically, like the nonsense of
      Justice Shallow, the clipped English of Dr. Cains, or the misplaced
      consonants of Fluellen. Of all confessors, Boswell is the most candid.
      Other men who have pretended to lay open their own hearts, Rousseau, for
      example, and Lord Byron, have evidently written with a constant view to
      effect, and are to be then most distrusted when they seem to be most
      sincere. There is scarcely any man who would not rather accuse himself of
      great crimes and of dark and tempestuous passions than proclaim all his
      little vanities and wild fancies. It would be easier to find a person who
      would avow actions like those of C√¶sar Borgia or Danton, than one who
      would publish a daydream like those of Alnaschar and Malvolio. Those
      weaknesses which most men keep covered up in the most secret places of the
      mind, not to be disclosed to the eve of friendship or of love, were
      precisely the weaknesses which Boswell paraded before all the world. He
      was perfectly frank, because the weakness of his understanding and the
      tumult of his spirits prevented him from knowing when he made himself
      ridiculous. His book resembles nothing so much as the conversation of the
      inmates of the Palace of Truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fame is great; and it will, we have no doubt, be lasting; but it is
      fame of a peculiar kind, and indeed marvellously resembles infamy. We
      remember no other case in which the world has made so great a distinction
      between a book and its author. In general, the book and the author are
      considered as one. To admire the book is to admire the author. The case of
      Boswell is an exception, we think the only exception, to this rule. His
      work is universally allowed to be interesting, instructive, eminently
      original: yet it has <span class="pagenum">396</span><a
      name="link396_rdquo_________id_" id="link396_rdquo_________id_"></a>brought
      him nothing but contempt. All the world reads it: all the world delights
      in it: yet we do not remember ever to have read or ever to have heard any
      expression of respect and admiration for the man to whom we owe so much
      instruction and amusement. While edition after edition of his book was
      coming forth, his son, as Mr. Croker tells us, was ashamed of it, and
      hated to hear it mentioned. This feeling was natural and reasonable. Sir
      Alexander saw that, in proportion, to the celebrity of the work, was the
      degradation of the author. The very editors of this unfortunate gentleman&rsquo;s
      books have forgotten their allegiance, and, like those Puritan casuists
      who took arms by the authority of the king against his person, have
      attacked the writer while doing homage to the writings. Mr. Croker, for
      example, has published two thousand five Mildred notes on the life of
      Johnson, and yet scarcely ever mentions the biographer whose performance
      he has taken such pains to illustrate without some expression of contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ill-natured man Boswell certainly was not. Yet the malignity of the
      most malignant satirist could scarcely cut deeper than his thoughtless
      loquacity. Having himself no sensibility to derision and contempt, he took
      it for granted that all others were equally callous. He was not ashamed to
      exhibit himself to the whole world as a common spy, a common tattler, a
      humble companion without the excuse of poverty, and to tell a hundred
      stories of his own pertness and folly, and of the insults which his
      pertness and folly brought upon him. It was natural that he should show
      little discretion in cases in which the feelings or the honour of others
      might be concerned. No man, surely, ever published such stories respecting
      persons whom he professed <span class="pagenum">397</span><a
      name="link397_rdquo_________id_" id="link397_rdquo_________id_"></a>to
      love and revere. He would infallibly have made his hero as contemptible as
      he has made himself, had not his hero really possessed some moral and
      intellectual qualities of a very high order. The best proof that Johnson
      was really an extraordinary man is that his character, instead of being
      degraded, has, on the whole, been decidedly raised by a work in which all
      his vices and weaknesses are exposed more unsparingly than they ever were
      exposed by Churchill or by Ken-rick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson grown old, Johnson in the fulness of his fame and in the enjoyment
      of a competent fortune, is better known to us than any other man in
      history. Every thing about him, his coat, his wig, his figure, his face,
      his scrofula, his St. Vitus&rsquo;s dance, his rolling walk, his blinking
      eye, the outward signs which too clearly marked his approbation of his
      dinner, his insatiable appetite for fish-sauce and veal-pie with plums,
      his inextinguishable thirst for tea, his trick of touching the posts as he
      walked, his mysterious practice of treasuring up scraps of orange-peel,
      his morning slumbers, his midnight disputations, his contortions, his
      mutter-ings, his gruntings, his puffings, his vigorous, acute, and ready
      eloquence, his sarcastic wit, his vehemence, his insolence, his fits of
      tempestuous rage, his queer inmates, old Mr. Levett and blind Mrs.
      Williams, the cat Hodge and the negro Frank, all are as familiar to us as
      the objects by which we have been surrounded from childhood. But we have
      no minute information respecting those years of Johnson&rsquo;s life
      during which his character and his manners became immutably fixed. We know
      him, not as he was known to the men of his own generation, but as he was
      known to men whose father he might have been. That celebrated club of
      <span class="pagenum">398</span><a name="link398" id="link398"></a>which
      he was the most distinguished member contained few persons who could
      remember a time when his fame was not fully established and his habits
      completely formed. He had made himself a name in literature while Reynolds
      and the Wartons were still boys. He was about twenty years older than
      Burke, Goldsmith, and Gerard Hamilton, about thirty years older than
      Gibbon, Beauclerk, and Langton, and about forty years older than Lord
      Stowell, Sir William Jones, and Windham. Boswell and Mrs. Thrale, the two
      writers from whom we derive most of our knowledge respecting him, never
      saw him till long after he was fifty years old, till most of his great
      works had become classical, and till the pension bestowed on him by the
      Crown had placed him above poverty. Of those eminent men who were his most
      intimate associates towards the close of his life, the only one, as far as
      we remember, who knew him during the first ten or twelve years of his
      residence in the capital, was David Garrick; and it does not appear that,
      during those years, David Garrick saw much of his fellow-townsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson came up to London precisely at the time when the condition of a
      man of letters was most miserable and degraded. It was a dark night
      between two sunny days. The age of patronage had passed away. The age of
      general curiosity and intelligence had not arrived. The number of readers
      is at present so great that a popular author may subsist in comfort and
      opulence on the profits of his works. In the reigns of William the Third,
      of Anne, and of George the First, even such men as Congreve and Addison
      would scarcely have been able to live like gentlemen by the mere sale of
      their writings. But the deficiency of the natural demand for literature
      was, at the close of the <span class="pagenum">399</span><a
      name="link399_rdquo_________id_" id="link399_rdquo_________id_"></a>seventeenth
      and at the beginning of the eighteenth century, more than made up by
      artificial encouragement, by a vast system of bounties and premiums. There
      was, perhaps, never a time at which the rewards of literary merit were so
      splendid, at which men who could write well found such easy admittance
      into the most distinguished society, and to the highest honours of the
      state. The chiefs of both the great parties into which the kingdom was
      divided patronised literature with emulous munificence. Congreve, when he
      had scarcely attained his majority, was rewarded for his first comedy with
      places which made him independent for life. Smith, though his Hippolytus
      and Ph√¶dra failed, would have been consoled with three hundred a year but
      for his own folly. Rowe was not only Poet Laureate, but also land-surveyor
      of the customs in the port of London, clerk of the council to the Prince
      of Wales, and secretary of the Presentations to the Lord Chancellor.
      Hughes was secretary to the Commissions of the Peace. Ambrose Philips was
      judge of the Prerogative Court in Ireland. Locke was Commissioner of
      Appeals and of the Board of Trade. Newton was Master of the Mint. Stepney
      and Prior were employed in embassies of high dignity and importance. Gay,
      who commenced life as apprentice to a silk mercer, became a secretary of
      legation at five-and-twenty. It was to a poem on the Death of Charles the
      Second, and to the City and Country Mouse, that Montague owed his
      introduction into public life, his earldom, his garter, and his
      Auditorship of the Exchequer. Swift, but for the unconquerable prejudice
      of the queen, would have been a bishop. Oxford, with his white staff in
      his hand, passed through the crowd of his suitors to welcome Parnell, when
      that ingenious <span class="pagenum">400</span><a name="link400"
      id="link400"></a>writer deserted the Whigs. Steele was a commissioner of
      stamps and a member of Parliament. Arthur Mainwaring was a commissioner of
      the customs, and auditor of the imprest. Tickell was secretary to the
      Lords Justices of Ireland. Addison was secretary of state.

      This liberal patronage was brought into fashion, as it seems, by the
      magnificent Dorset, almost the only noble versifier in the court of
      Charles the Second who possessed talents for composition which were
      independent of the aid of a coronet. Montague owed his elevation to the
      favour of Dorset, and imitated through the whole course of his life the
      liberality to which he was himself so greatly indebted. The Tory leaders,
      Harley and Bolingbroke in particular, vied with the chiefs of the Whig
      party in zeal for the encouragement of letters. But soon after the
      accession of the house of Hanover a change took place. The supreme power
      passed to a man who cared little for poetry or eloquence. The importance
      of the House of Commons was constantly on the increase. The government was
      under the necessity of bartering for Parliamentary support much of that
      patronage which had been employed in fostering literary merit; and Walpole
      was by no means inclined to divert any part of the fund of corruption to
      purposes which he considered as idle. He had eminent talents for
      government and for debate. But he had paid little attention to books, and
      felt little respect for authors. One of the coarse jokes of his friend,
      Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, was far more pleasing to him than Thomson&rsquo;s
      Seasons or Richardson&rsquo;s Pamela. He had observed that some of the
      distinguished writers whom the favour of Halifax had turned into statesmen
      had been mere encumbrances <span class="pagenum">401</span><a
      name="link401" id="link401"></a>to their party, dawdlers in office, and
      mutes in Parliament. During the whole course of his administration,
      therefore, he scarcely befriended a single man of genius. The best writers
      of the age gave all their support to the opposition, and contributed to
      excite that discontent which, after plunging the nation into a foolish and
      unjust war, overthrew the minister to make room for men less able and
      equally immoral. The opposition could reward its eulogists with little
      more than promises and caresses. St. James&rsquo;s would give nothing:
      Leicester house had nothing to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, at the time when Johnson commenced his literary career, a writer had
      little to hope from the patronage of powerful individuals. The patronage
      of the public did not yet furnish the means of comfortable subsistence.
      The prices paid by booksellers to authors were so low that a man of
      considerable talents and unremitting industry could do little more than
      provide for the day which was passing over him. The lean kine had eaten up
      the fat kine. The thin and withered ears had devoured the good ears. The
      season of rich harvests was over, and the period of famine had begun. All
      that is squalid and miserable might now be summed up in the word Poet.
      That word denoted a creature dressed like a scarecrow, familiar with
      compters and spunging-houses, and perfectly qualified to decide on the
      comparative merits of the Common Side in the King&rsquo;s Bench prison and
      of Mount Scoundrel in the Fleet. Even the poorest pitied him; and they
      well might pity him. For if their condition was equally abject, their
      aspirings were not equally high, nor their sense of insult equally acute.
      To lodge in a garret up four pairs of stairs, to dine in a cellar among
      footmen out of place, to translate ten hours a day for <span
      class="pagenum">402</span><a name="link402" id="link402"></a>the wages of
      a ditcher, to be hunted by bailiffs from one haunt of beggary and
      pestilence to another, from Grub Street to St. George&rsquo;s Fields, and
      from St. George&rsquo;s Fields to the alleys behind St. Martin&rsquo;s
      church, to sleep on a bulk in June and amidst the ashes of a glass-house
      in December, to die in an hospital and to be buried in a parish vault, was
      the fate of more than one writer who, if he had lived thirty years
      earlier, would have been admitted to the sittings of the Kitcat or the
      Scriblerus club, would have sat in Parliament, and would have been
      entrusted with embassies to the High Allies; who, if he had lived in our
      time, would have found encouragement scarcely less munificent in Albemarle
      Street or in Paternoster Row.

      As every climate has its peculiar diseases, so every walk of life has its
      peculiar temptations. The literary character, assuredly, has always had
      its share of faults, vanity, jealousy, morbid sensibility. To these faults
      were now superadded the faults which are commonly found in men whose
      livelihood is precarious, and whose principles are exposed to the trial of
      severe distress. All the vices of the gambler and of the beggar were
      blended with those of the author. The prizes in the wretched lottery of
      book-making were scarcely less ruinous than the blanks. If good fortune
      came, it came in such a manner that it was almost certain to be abused.
      After months of starvation and despair, a full third night or a
      well-received dedication filled the pocket of the lean, ragged, unwashed
      poet with guineas. He hastened to enjoy those luxuries with the images of
      which his mind had been haunted while he was sleeping amidst the cinders
      and eating potatoes at the Irish ordinary in Shoe Lane. A week of taverns
      soon qualified him for another year of night-cellars. <span class="pagenum">403</span><a
      name="link403" id="link403"></a>Such was the life of Savage, of Boyse, and
      of a crowd of others. Sometimes blazing in gold-laced hats and waistcoats;
      sometimes lying in bed because their coats had gone to pieces, or wearing
      paper cravats because their linen was in pawn; sometimes drinking
      Champagne and Tokay with Betty Careless; sometimes standing at the window
      of an eating-house in Porridge island, to snuff up the scent of what they
      could not afford to taste; they knew luxury; they knew beggary; but they
      never knew comfort. These men were irreclaimable. They looked on a regular
      and frugal life with the same aversion which an old gipsy or a Mohawk
      hunter feels for a stationary abode, and for the restraints and securities
      of civilised communities. They were as untameable, as much wedded to their
      desolate freedom, as the wild ass. They could no more be broken into the
      offices of social man than the unicorn could be trained to serve and abide
      by the crib. It was well if they did not, like beasts of a still fiercer
      race, tear the hands which ministered to their necessities. To assist them
      was impossible; and the most benevolent of mankind at length became weary
      of giving relief which was dissipated with the wildest profusion as soon
      as it had been received. If a sum was bestowed on the wretched adventurer,
      such as, properly husbanded, might have supplied him for six months, it
      was instantly spent in strange freaks of sensuality, and, before
      forty-eight hours had elapsed, the poet was again pestering all his
      acquaintance for twopence to get a plate of shin of beef at a
      subterraneous cook-shop. If his friends gave him an asylum in their
      houses, those houses were forthwith turned into bagnios and taverns. All
      order was destroyed; all business was suspended. The most good-natured
      host <span class="pagenum">404</span><a name="link404" id="link404"></a>began
      to repent of his eagerness to serve a man of genius in distress when he
      heard his guest roaring for fresh punch at five o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few eminent writers were more fortunate. Pope had been raised above
      poverty by the active patronage which, in his youth, both the great
      political parties had extended to his Homer. Young had received the only
      pension ever bestowed, to the best of our recollection, by Sir Robert
      Walpole, as the reward of mere literary merit. One or two of the many
      poets who attached themselves to the opposition, Thomson in particular and
      Mallet, obtained, after much severe suffering, the means of subsistence
      from their political friends. Richardson, like a man of sense, kept his
      shop; and his shop kept him, which his novels, admirable as they are,
      would scarcely have done. But nothing could be more deplorable than the
      state even of the ablest men, who at that time depended for subsistence on
      their writings. Johnson, Collins, Fielding, and Thomson, were certainly
      four of the most distinguished persons that England produced during the
      eighteenth century. It is well known that they were all four arrested for
      debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into calamities and difficulties such as these Johnson plunged in his
      twenty-eighth year. From that time till he was three or four and fifty, we
      have little information respecting him; little, we mean, compared with the
      full and accurate information which we possess respecting his proceedings
      and habits towards the close of his life. He emerged at length from
      cock-lofts and sixpenny ordinaries into the society of the polished and
      the opulent. His fame was established. A pension sufficient for his wants
      had been conferred on him: and he came forth to astonish a generation with
      which <span class="pagenum">405</span><a name="link405" id="link405"></a>he
      had almost as little in common as with Frenchmen or Spaniards.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his early years he had occasionally seen the great: hut he had seen
      them as a beggar. He now came among them as a companion. The demand for
      amusement and instruction had, during the course of twenty years, been
      gradually increasing. The price of literary labour had risen; and those
      rising men of letters with whom Johnson was henceforth to associate were
      for the most part persons widely different from those who had walked about
      with him all night in the streets for want of a lodging. Burke, Robertson,
      the Wartons, Gray, Mason, Gibbon, Adam Smith, Beattie, Sir William Jones,
      Goldsmith, and Churchill, were the most distinguished writers of what may
      be called the second generation of the Johnsonian age. Of these men
      Churchill was the only one in whom we can trace the stronger lineaments of
      that character which, when Johnson first came up to London, was common
      among authors. Of the rest, scarcely any had felt the pressure of severe
      poverty. Almost all had been early admitted into the most respectable
      society on an equal footing. They were men of quite a different species
      from the dependents of Curll and Osborne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson came among them the solitary specimen of a past age, the last
      survivor of the genuine race of Grub Street hacks; the last of that
      generation of authors whose abject misery and whose dissolute manners had
      furnished inexhaustible matter to the satirical genius of Pope. From
      nature, he had received an uncouth figure, a diseased constitution, and an
      irritable temper. The manner in which the earlier years of his manhood had
      been passed had given to his demeanour, and even to his moral character,
      some peculiarities appalling <span class="pagenum">406</span><a
      name="link406" id="link406"></a>to the civilised beings who were the
      companions of his old age. The perverse irregularity of his hours, the
      slovenliness of his person, his fits of strenuous exertion, interrupted by
      long intervals of sluggishness, his strange abstinence, and his equally
      strange voracity, his active benevolence, contrasted with the constant
      rudeness and the occasional ferocity of his manners In society, made him,
      in the opinion of those with whom he lived during the last twenty years of
      his life, a complete original. An original he was, undoubtedly, in some
      respects. But if we possessed full information concerning those who shared
      his early hardships, we should probably find that what we call his
      singularities of manner were, for the most part, failings which he had in
      common with the class to which he belonged. He ate at Streatham Park as he
      had been used to eat behind the screen at St. John&rsquo;s Gate, when he
      was ashamed to show his ragged clothes. He ate as it was natural that a
      man should eat, who, during a great part of his life, had passed the
      morning in doubt whether he should have food for the afternoon. The habits
      of his early life had accustomed him to bear privation with fortitude, but
      not to taste pleasure with moderation. He could fast; but, when he did not
      fast, he tore his dinner like a famished wolf, with the veins swelling on
      his forehead, and the perspiration running down his cheeks. He scarcely
      ever took wine. But when he drank it, he drank it greedily and in large
      tumblers. These were, in fact, mitigated symptoms of that same moral
      disease which raged with such deadly malignity in his friends Savage and
      Boyse. The roughness and violence which he showed in society were to be
      expected from a man whose temper, not naturally gentle, had been long
      tried by the bitterest <span class="pagenum">407</span><a
      name="link407_rdquo_________id_" id="link407_rdquo_________id_"></a>calamities,
      by the want of meat, of fire, and of clothes, by the importunity of
      creditors, by the insolence of booksellers, by the derision of fools, by
      the insincerity of patrons, by that bread which is the bitterest of all
      food, by those stairs which are the most toilsome of all paths, by that
      deferred hope which makes the heart sick. Through all these things the
      ill-dressed, coarse, ungainly pedant had struggled manfully up to eminence
      and command. It was natural that, in the exercise of his power, he should
      be &ldquo;eo immitior, quia tolera-verat,&rdquo; that, though his heart
      was undoubtedly generous and humane, his demeanour in society should be
      harsh and despotic. For severe distress he had sympathy, and not only
      sympathy, but munificent relief. But for the suffering which a harsh world
      inflicts upon a delicate mind he had no pity; for it was a kind of
      suffering which he could scarcely conceive. He would carry home on his
      shoulders a sick and starving girl from the streets. He turned his house
      into a place of refuge for a crowd of wretched old creatures who could
      find no other asylum; nor could all their peevishness and ingratitude
      weary out his benevolence. But the pangs of wounded vanity seemed to him
      ridiculous; and he scarcely felt sufficient compassion even for the pangs
      of wounded affection. He had seen and felt so much of sharp misery, that
      he was not affected by paltry vexations; and he seemed to think that every
      body ought to be as much hardened to those vexations as himself. He was
      angry with Boswell for complaining of a headache, with Mrs. Thrale for
      grumbling about the dust on the road, or the smell of the kitchen. These
      were, in his phrase, &ldquo;foppish lamentations,&rdquo; which people
      ought to be ashamed to utter in a world so full of sin and sorrow.
      Goldsmith crying because the Good-natured <span class="pagenum">408</span><a
      name="link408_rdquo_________id_" id="link408_rdquo_________id_"></a>Man
      had failed, inspired him with no pity. Though his own health was not good,
      he detested and despised valetudinarians. Pecuniary losses, unless they
      reduced the loser absolutely to beggary, moved him very little. People
      whose hearts had been softened by prosperity might weep, he said, for such
      events; but all that could be expected of a plain man was not to laugh. He
      was not much moved even by the spectacle of Lady Tavistock dying of a
      broken heart for the loss of her lord. Such grief he considered as a
      luxury reserved for the idle and the wealthy. A washerwoman, left a widow
      with nine small children, would not have sobbed herself to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      A person who troubled himself so little about small or sentimental
      grievances was not likely to be very attentive to the feelings of others
      in the ordinary intercourse of society. He could not understand how a
      sarcasm or a reprimand could make any man really unhappy. &ldquo;My dear
      doctor,&rdquo; said he to Goldsmith, &ldquo;what harm does it do to a man
      to call him Holofernes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he exclaimed to Mrs. Carter, &ldquo;who
      is the worse for being talked of uncharitably?&rdquo; Politeness has been
      well defined as benevolence in small things. Johnson was impolite, not
      because he wanted benevolence, but because small things appeared smaller
      to him than to people who had never known what it was to live for
      fourpence halfpenny a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The characteristic peculiarity of his intellect was the union of great
      powers with low prejudices. If we judged of him by the best parts of his
      mind, we should place him almost as high as he was placed by the idolatry
      of Boswell; if by the worst parts of his mind, we should place him even
      below Boswell himself. Where <span class="pagenum">409</span><a
      name="link409" id="link409"></a>he was not under the influence of some
      strange scruple, or some domineering passion, which prevented him from
      boldly investigating a subject, he was a wary and acute reasoner, a little
      too much inclined to scepticism, and a little too fond of paradox. No man
      was less likely to be imposed upon by fallacies in argument or by
      exaggerated statements of fact. But if, while he was beating down sophisms
      and exposing false testimony, some childish prejudices, such as would
      excite laughter in a well managed nursery, came across him, he was smitten
      as if by enchantment. His mind dwindled away under the spell from gigantic
      elevation to dwarfish littleness. Those who had lately been admiring its
      amplitude and its force were now as much astonished at its strange
      narrowness and feebleness as the fisherman in the Arabian tale, when he
      saw the Genie, whose stature had overshadowed the whole sea-coast, and
      whose might seemed equal to a contest with armies, contract himself to the
      dimensions of his small prison, and lie there the helpless slave of the
      charm of Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson was in the habit of sifting with extreme severity the evidence for
      all stories which were merely odd. But when they were not only odd but
      miraculous, his severity relaxed. He began to be credulous precisely at
      the point where the most credulous people begin to be sceptical. It is
      curious to observe, both in his writings and in his conversation, the
      contrast between the disdainful manner in which he rejects unauthenticated
      anecdotes, even when they are consistent with the general laws of nature,
      and the respectful manner in which he mentions the wildest stories
      relating to the invisible world. A man who told him of a water-spout or a
      meteoric stone generally had the lie <span class="pagenum">410</span><a
      name="link410" id="link410"></a>direct given him for his pains. A man who
      told him of a prediction or a dream wonderfully accomplished was sure of a
      courteous hearing. &ldquo;Johnson,&rdquo; observed Hogarth, &ldquo;like
      King David, says in his haste that all men are liars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His incredulity,&rdquo; says Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;amounted almost to
      disease.&rdquo; She tells us how he browbeat a gentleman, who gave him an
      account of a hurricane in the West Indies, and a poor quaker who related
      some strange circumstance about the red-hot balls fired at the siege of
      Gibraltar. &ldquo;It is not so. It cannot be true. Don&rsquo;t tell that
      story again. You cannot think how poor a figure you make in telling it.&rdquo;
      He once said, half jestingly we suppose, that for six months he refused to
      credit the fact of the earthquake at Lisbon, and that he still believed
      the extent of the calamity to be greatly exaggerated. Yet he related with
      a grave face how old Mr. Cave of St. John&rsquo;s Gate saw a ghost, and
      how this ghost was something of a shadowy being. He went himself on a
      ghost-hunt, to Cock Lane, and was angry with John Wesley for not following
      up another scent of the same kind with proper spirit and perseverance. He
      rejects the Celtic genealogies and poems without the least hesitation; yet
      he declares himself willing to believe the stories of the second sight. If
      he had examined the claims of the Highland seers with half the severity
      with which he sifted the evidence for the genuineness of Fingal, he would,
      we suspect, have come away from Scotland with a mind fully made up. In his
      Lives of the Poets, we find that he is unwilling to give credit to the
      accounts of Lord Roscommon&rsquo;s early proficiency in his studies; but
      he tells with great solemnity an absurd romance about some intelligence
      preternaturally impressed on the mind of that nobleman. He avows <span
      class="pagenum">411</span><a name="link411" id="link411"></a>himself to be
      in great doubt about the truth of the story, and ends by warning his
      readers not wholly to slight such impressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of his sentiments on religious subjects are worthy of a liberal and
      enlarged mind. He could discern clearly enough the folly and meanness of
      all bigotry except his own. When he spoke of the scruples of the Puritans,
      he spoke like a person who had really obtained an insight into the divine
      philosophy of the New Testament, and who considered Christianity as a
      noble scheme of government, tending to promote the happiness and to
      elevate the moral nature of man. The horror which the sectaries felt for
      cards, Christmas ale, plum-porridge, mince-pies, and dancing bears,
      excited his contempt. To the arguments urged by some very worthy people
      against showy dress he replied with admirable sense and spirit, &ldquo;Let
      us not be found, when our Master calls us, stripping the lace off our
      waistcoats, but the spirit of contention from our souls and tongues. Alas!
      sir, a man who cannot get to heaven in a green coat will not find his way
      thither the sooner in a grey one.&rdquo; Yet he was himself under the
      tyranny of scruples as unreasonable as those of Hudibras or Ralpho, and
      carried his zeal for ceremonies and for ecclesiastical dignities to
      lengths altogether inconsistent with reason or with Christian charity. He
      has gravely noted down in his diary that he once committed the sin of
      drinking coffee on Good Friday. In Scotland, he thought it his duty to
      pass several months without joining in public worship, solely because the
      ministers of the kirk had not been ordained by bishops. His mode of
      estimating the piety of his neighbours was somewhat singular. &ldquo;Campbell,&rdquo;
      said he, &ldquo;is a good <span class="pagenum">412</span><a name="link412"
      id="link412"></a>man, a pious man. I am afraid he has not been in the
      inside of a church for many years; but he never passes a church without
      pulling off his hat: this shows he has good principles.&rdquo; Spain and
      Sicily must surely contain many pious robbers and well-principled
      assassins. Johnson could easily see that a Roundhead who named all his
      children after Solomon&rsquo;s singers, and talked in the House of Commons
      about seeking the Lord, might be an unprincipled villain whose religious
      mummeries only aggravated his guilt. But a man who took off his hat when
      he passed a church episcopally consecrated must be a good man, a pious
      man, a man of good principles. Johnson could easily see that those persons
      who looked on a dance or a laced waistcoat as sinful, deemed most ignobly
      of the attributes of God and of the ends of revelation. But with what a
      storm of invective he would have overwhelmed any man who had blamed him
      for celebrating the redemption of mankind with sugarless tea and
      butterless buns.

      Nobody spoke more contemptuously of the cant of patriotism. Nobody saw
      more clearly the error of those who regarded liberty, not as a means, but
      as an end, and who proposed to themselves, as the object of their pursuit,
      the prosperity of the state as distinct from the prosperity of the
      individuals who compose the state. His calm and settled opinion seems to
      have been that forms of government have little or no influence on the
      happiness of society. This opinion, erroneous as it is, ought at least to
      have preserved him from all intemperance on political questions. It did
      not, however, preserve him from the lowest, fiercest, and most absurd
      extravagances of party-spirit, from rants which, in every thing but the
      diction, resembled those of Squire <span class="pagenum">413</span><a
      name="link413" id="link413"></a>Western. He was, as a politician, half ice
      and half fire. On the side of his intellect he was a mere Pococurante, far
      too apathetic about public affairs, far too sceptical as to the good or
      evil tendency of any form of polity. His passions, on the contrary, were
      violent even to slaying against all who leaned to Whiggish principles. The
      well-known lines which he inserted in Goldsmith&rsquo;s Traveller express
      what seems to have been his deliberate judgment: <br /><br /><span
      class="indent20">"How small, of all that human hearts endure, <br /><span
      class="indent20">That part which kings or laws can cause or cure!&rdquo;
      </span></span>

      He had previously put expressions very similar into the mouth of Rasselas.
      It is amusing to contrast these passages with the torrents of raving abuse
      which he poured forth against the Long Parliament and the American
      Congress. In one of the conversations reported by Boswell this
      inconsistency displays itself in the most ludicrous manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Adam Ferguson,&rdquo; says Boswell, &ldquo;suggested that
      luxury corrupts a people, and destroys the spirit of liberty. Johnson:
      &lsquo;Sir, that is all visionary. I would not give half a guinea to live
      under one form of government rather than another. It is of no moment to
      the happiness of an individual. Sir, the danger of the abuse of power is
      nothing to a private man. What Frenchman is prevented passing his life as
      he pleases?&rsquo; Sir Adam: &lsquo;But, sir, in the British constitution
      it is surely of importance to keep up a spirit in the people, so as to
      preserve a balance against the crown.&rsquo; Johnson: &lsquo;Sir, I
      perceive you are a vile Whig. Why all this childish jealousy of the power
      of the crown? The crown has not power enough.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the old philosophers, Lord Bacon tells us, used to say that life
      and death were just the same to <span class="pagenum">414</span><a
      name="link414" id="link414"></a>him. &ldquo;Why then,&rdquo; said an
      objector, &ldquo;do you not kill yourself?&rdquo; The philosopher
      answered, &ldquo;Because it is just the same.&rdquo; If the difference
      between two forms of government be not worth half a guinea, it is not easy
      to see how Whiggism can he viler than Toryism, or how the crown can have
      too little power. If the happiness of individuals is not affected by
      political abuses, zeal for liberty is doubtless ridiculous. But zeal for
      monarchy must be equally so. No person would have been more quick-sighted
      than Johnson to such a contradiction as this in the logic of an
      antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judgments which Johnson passed on books were, in his own time,
      regarded with superstitious veneration, and, in our time, are generally
      treated with indiscriminate contempt. They are the judgments of a strong
      but enslaved understanding. The mind of the critic was hedged round by an
      uninterrupted fence of prejudices and superstitions. Within his narrow
      limits, he displayed a vigour and an activity which ought to have enabled
      him to clear the barrier that confined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      How it chanced that a man who reasoned on his premises so ably, should
      assume his premises so foolishly, is one of the great mysteries of human
      nature. The same inconsistency may be observed in the schoolmen of the
      middle ages. Those writers show so much acuteness and force of mind in
      arguing on their wretched data, that a modern reader is perpetually at a
      loss to comprehend how such minds came by such data. Not a flaw in the
      superstructure of the theory which they are rearing escapes their
      vigilance. Yet they are blind to the obvious unsoundness of the
      foundation. It is the same with some eminent lawyers. <span class="pagenum">415</span><a
      name="link415" id="link415"></a>Their legal arguments are intellectual
      prodigies, abounding with the happiest analogies and the most refined
      distinctions. The principles of their arbitrary science being once
      admitted, the statute-book and the reports being once assumed as the
      foundations of reasoning, these men must be allowed to be perfect masters
      of logic. But if a question arises as to the postulates on which their
      whole system rests, if they are called upon to vindicate the fundamental
      maxims of that system which they have passed their lives in studying,
      these very men often talk the language of savages or of children. Those
      who have listened to a man of this class in his own court, and who have
      witnessed the skill with which he analyses and digests a vast mass of
      evidence, or reconciles a crowd of precedents which at first sight seem
      contradictory, scarcely know him again when, a few hours later, they hear
      him speaking on the other side of Westminster Hall in his capacity of
      legislator. They can scarcely believe that the paltry quirks which are
      faintly heard through a storm of coughing, and which do not impose on the
      plainest country gentleman, can proceed from the same sharp and vigorous
      intellect which had excited their admiration under the same roof, and on
      the same day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson decided literary questions like a lawyer, not like a legislator.
      He never examined foundations where a point was already ruled. His whole
      code of criticism rested on pure assumption, for which he sometimes quoted
      a precedent or an authority, but rarely troubled himself to give a reason
      drawn from the nature of things. He took it for granted that the kind of
      poetry which flourished in his own time, which he had been accustomed to
      hear praised from his childhood, and which he had himself written with
      success, <span class="pagenum">416</span><a name="link416" id="link416"></a>was
      the best kind of poetry. In his biographical work he has repeatedly laid
      it down as an undeniable, proposition that during the latter part of the
      seventeenth century, and the earlier part of the eighteenth, English
      poetry had been in a constant progress of improvement. Waller, Denham,
      Dryden, and Pope, had been, according to him, the great reformers. He
      judged of all works of the imagination by the standard established among
      his own contemporaries. Though he allowed Homer to have been a greater man
      than Virgil, he seems to have thought the √Üneid a greater poem than the
      Iliad. Indeed he well might have thought so; for he preferred Pope&rsquo;s
      Iliad to Homer&rsquo;s. He pronounced that, after Hoole&rsquo;s
      translation of Tasso, Fairfax&rsquo;s would hardly be reprinted. He could
      see no merit, in our fine old English ballads, and always spoke with the
      most provoking contempt of Percy&rsquo;s fondness for them. Of the great
      original works of imagination which appeared during his time, Richardson&rsquo;s
      novels alone excited his admiration. He could see little or no merit in
      Tom Jones, in Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels, or in Tristram Shandy. To Thomson&rsquo;s
      Castle of Indolence, he vouchsafed only a line of cold commendation, of
      commendation much colder than what he has bestowed on the Creation of that
      portentous bore, Sir Richard Blackmore. Gray was, in his dialect, a barren
      rascal. Churchill was a blockhead. The contempt which he felt for the
      trash of Macpherson was indeed just; but it was, we suspect, just by
      chance. He despised the Fingal for the very reason which led many men of
      genius to admire it. He despised it, not because it was essentially
      common-place, but because it had a superficial air of originality.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was undoubtedly an excellent judge of compositions <span class="pagenum">417</span><a
      name="link417" id="link417"></a>fashioned on his own principles. But when
      a deeper philosophy was required, when he undertook to pronounce judgment
      on the works of those great minds which &ldquo;yield homage only to
      eternal laws,&rdquo; his failure was ignominious. He criticized Pope&rsquo;s
      Epitaphs excellently. But his observations on Shakspeare&rsquo;s plays and
      Milton&rsquo;s poems seem to us for the most part as wretched as if they
      had been written by Rymer himself, whom we take to have been the worst
      critic that ever lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of Johnson&rsquo;s whims on literary subjects can be compared only to
      that strange nervous feeling which made him uneasy if he had not touched
      every post between the Mitre tavern and his own lodgings. Hiss preference
      of Latin epitaphs to English epitaphs is an instance. An English epitaph,
      he said, would disgrace Smollett. He declared that he would not pollute
      the walls of Westminster Abbey with an English epitaph on Goldsmith. What
      reason there can be for celebrating a British writer in Latin, which there
      was not for covering the Roman arches of triumph with Greek inscriptions,
      or for commemorating the deeds of the heroes of Thermopyl√¶ in Egyptian
      hieroglyphics, we are utterly unable to imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      On men and manners, at least on the men and manners of a particular place
      and a particular age, Johnson had certainly looked with a most observant
      and discriminating eye. His remarks on the education of children, on
      marriage, on the economy of families, on the rules of society, are always
      striking, and generally sound. In his writings, indeed, the knowledge of
      life which he possessed in an eminent degree is very imperfectly
      exhibited. Like those unfortunate chiefs of the middle ages who were
      suffocated by their own chain-mail and cloth of gold, his maxims perish
      under that <span class="pagenum">418</span><a name="link418" id="link418"></a>load
      of words which was designed! for their defence and their ornament. But it
      is clear from the remains of his conversation, that he had more of that
      homely wisdom which nothing but experience and observation can give than
      any writer since the time of Swift. If he had been content to write as he
      talked, he might have left books on the practical art of living superior
      to the Directions to Servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet even his remarks on society, like his remarks on literature, indicate
      a mind at least as remarkable for narrowness as for strength. He was no
      master of the great science of human nature. He had studied, not the genus
      man, but the species Londoner. Nobody was ever so thoroughly conversant
      with all the forms of life and all the shades of moral and intellectual
      character which were to be seen from Islington to the Thames, and from
      Hyde-Park corner to Mile-end green. But his philosophy stopped at the
      first turnpike-gate. Of the rural life of England he knew nothing; and he
      took it for granted that every body who lived in the country was either
      stupid or miserable. &ldquo;Country gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;must
      be unhappy; for they have not enough to keep their lives in motion;&rdquo;
      as if all those peculiar habits and associations which made Fleet Street
      and Charing Cross the finest views in the world to himself had been
      essential parts of human nature. Of remote countries and past times he
      talked with wild and ignorant presumption. &ldquo;The Athenians of the age
      of Demosthenes,&rdquo; he said to Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;were a people of
      brutes, a barbarous people.&rdquo; In conversation with Sir Adam Ferguson
      he used similar language. &ldquo;The boasted Athenians,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;were barbarians. The mass of every people must be barbarous where
      there is no printing.&rdquo; The fact was <span class="pagenum">419</span><a
      name="link419" id="link419"></a>this: he saw that a Londoner who could not
      read was a very stupid and brutal fellow: he saw that great refinement of
      taste and activity of intellect were rarely found in a Londoner who had
      not read much; and, because it was by means of books that people acquired
      almost all their knowledge in the society with which he was acquainted, he
      concluded, in defiance of the strongest and clearest evidence, that the
      human mind can be cultivated by means of books alone. An Athenian citizen
      might possess very few volumes; and the largest library to which he had
      access might be much less valuable than Johnson&rsquo;s bookcase in Bolt
      Court. But the Athenian might pass every morning in conversation with
      Socrates, and might hear Pericles speak four or five times every month. He
      saw the plays of Sophocles and Aristophanes: he walked amidst the friezes
      of Phidias and the paintings of Zeuxis: he knew by heart the choruses of
      √Üschylus: he heard the rhapsodist at the corner of the street reciting the
      shield of Achilles or the Death of Argus: he was a legislator, conversant
      with high questions of alliance, revenue, and war: he was a soldier,
      trained under a liberal and generous discipline: he was a judge, compelled
      every day to weigh the effect of opposite arguments. These things were in
      themselves an education, an education eminently fitted, not, indeed, to
      farm exact or profound thinkers, but to give quickness to the perceptions,
      delicacy to the taste, fluency to the expression, and politeness to the
      manners. All this was overlooked. An Athenian who did not improve his mind
      by reading was, in Johnson&rsquo;s opinion, much such a person as a
      Cockney who made his mark, much such a person as black Frank before he
      went to school, and far inferior to a parish clerk or a printer&rsquo;s
      devil. <span class="pagenum">420</span><a name="link420" id="link420"></a>Johnson&rsquo;s
      friends have allowed that he carried to a ridiculous extreme his unjust
      contempt for foreigners. He pronounced the French to be a very silly
      people, much behind us, stupid, ignorant creatures. And this judgment he
      formed after having been at Paris about a month, during which he would not
      talk French, for fear of giving the natives an advantage over him in
      conversation. He pronounced them, also, to be an indelicate people,
      because a French footman touched the sugar with his fingers. That
      ingenious and amusing traveller, M. Simond, has defended his countrymen
      very successfully against Johnson&rsquo;s accusation, and has pointed out
      some English practices which, to an impartial spectator, would seem at
      least as inconsistent with physical cleanliness and social decorum as
      those which Johnson so bitterly reprehended. To the sage, as Boswell loves
      to call him, it never occurred to doubt that there must be something
      eternally and immutably good in the usages to which he had been
      accustomed. In fact, Johnson&rsquo;s remarks on society beyond the bills
      of mortality, are generally of much the same kind with those of honest Tom
      Dawson, the English footman in Dr. Moore&rsquo;s Zeluco. &ldquo;Suppose
      the king of France has no sons, but only a daughter, then, when the king
      dies, this here daughter, according to that there law, cannot be made
      queen, but the next near relative, provided he is a man, is made king, and
      not the last king&rsquo;s daughter, which, to be sure, is very unjust. The
      French footguards are dressed in blue, and all the marching regiments in
      white, which has a very foolish appearance for soldiers; and as for blue
      regimentals, it is only fit for the blue horse or the artillery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson&rsquo;s visit to the Hebrides introduced him to a state of society
      completely new to him; and a salutary <span class="pagenum">421</span><a
      name="link421" id="link421"></a>suspicion of his own deficiencies seems on
      that occasion to have crossed his mind for the first time. He confessed,
      in the last paragraph of his Journey, that his thoughts on national
      manners were the thoughts of one who had seen but little, of one who had
      passed his time almost wholly in cities. This feeling, however, soon
      passed away. It is remarkable that to the last he entertained a fixed
      contempt for all those modes of life and those studies which tend to
      emancipate the mind from the prejudices of a particular age or a
      particular nation. Of foreign travel and of history he spoke with the
      fierce and boisterous contempt of ignorance. &ldquo;What does a man learn
      by travelling? Is Beauclerk the better for travelling? What did Lord
      Charlemont learn in his travels, except that there was a snake in one of
      the pyramids of Egypt?&rdquo; History was, in his opinion, to use the fine
      expression of Lord Plunkett, an old almanack: historians could, as he
      conceived, claim no higher dignity than that of almanack-makers; and his
      favourite historians were those who, like Lord Hailes, aspired to no
      higher dignity. He always spoke with contempt of Robertson. Hume he would
      not even read. He affronted one of his friends for talking to him about
      Catiline&rsquo;s conspiracy, and declared that he never desired to hear of
      the Punic war again as long as he lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuredly one fact which does not directly affect our own interests,
      considered in itself, is no better worth knowing than another fact. The
      fact that there is a snake in a pyramid, or the fact that Hannibal crossed
      the Alps, are in themselves as unprofitable to us as the fact that there
      is a green blind in a particular house in Threadneedle Street, or the fact
      <span class="pagenum">422</span><a name="link422" id="link422"></a>that a
      Mr. Smith comes into the city every morning on the top of one of the
      Blackwall stages. But it is certain that those who will not crack the
      shell of history will never get at the kernel. Johnson, with hasty
      arrogance, pronounced the kernel worthless, because he saw no value in the
      shell. The real use of travelling to distant countries and of studying the
      annals of past times is to preserve men from the contraction of mind which
      those can hardly escape whose whole communion is with one generation and
      one neighbourhood, who arrive at conclusions by means of an induction not
      sufficiently copious, and who therefore constantly confound exceptions
      with rules, and accidents with essential properties. In short, the real
      use of travelling and of studying history is to keep men from being what
      Tom Dawson was in fiction, and Samuel Johnson in reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson, as Mr. Burke most justly observed, appears far greater in Boswell&rsquo;s
      books than in his own. His conversation appears to have been quite equal
      to his writings in matter, and far superior to them in manner. When he
      talked, he clothed his wit and his sense in forcible and natural
      expressions. As soon as he took his pen in his hand to write for the
      public, his style became systematically vicious. All his books are written
      in a learned language, in a language which nobody hears from his mother or
      his nurse, in a language in which nobody ever quarrels, or drives
      bargains, or makes love, in a language in which nobody ever thinks. It is
      clear that Johnson himself did not think in the dialect in which he wrote.
      The expressions which came first to his tongue were simple, energetic, and
      picturesque. When he wrote for publication, he did his sentences out of
      English into <span class="pagenum">423</span><a name="link423" id="link423"></a>Johnsonese.
      His letters from the Hebrides to Mrs. Thrale are the original of that work
      of which the Journey to the Hebrides is the translation; and it is amusing
      to compare the two versions. &ldquo;When we were taken up stairs,&rdquo;
      says he in one of his letters, &ldquo;a dirty fellow bounced out of the
      bed on which one of us was to lie.&rdquo; This incident is recorded in the
      Journey as follows: &ldquo;Out of one of the beds on which we were to
      repose started up, at our entrance, a man black as a Cyclops from the
      forge.&rdquo; Sometimes Johnson translated aloud. &ldquo;The Rehearsal,&rdquo;
      he said, very unjustly, &ldquo;has not wit enough to keep it sweet;&rdquo;
      then, after a pause, &ldquo;it has not vitality enough to preserve it from
      putrefaction.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mannerism is pardonable, and is sometimes even agreeable, when the manner,
      though vicious, is natural. Few readers, for example, would be willing to
      part with the mannerism of Milton or of Burke. But a mannerism which does
      not sit easy on the mannerist, which has been adopted on principle, and
      which can be sustained only by constant effort, is always offensive. And
      such is the mannerism of Johnson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The characteristic faults of his style are so familiar to all our readers,
      and have been so often burlesqued, that it is almost superfluous to point
      them out. It is well known that he made less use than any other eminent
      writer of those strong plain words, Anglo-Saxon or Norman-French, of which
      the roots lie in the inmost depths of our language; and that he felt a
      vicious partiality for terms which, long after our own speech had been
      fixed, were borrowed from the Greek and Latin, and which, therefore, even
      when lawfully naturalised, must be considered as born aliens, not entitled
      to rank with the king&rsquo;s English. His constant practice <span
      class="pagenum">424</span><a name="link424" id="link424"></a>of padding
      out a sentence with useless epithets, till it became as stiff as the bust
      of an exquisite, his antithetical forms of expression, constantly employed
      even where there is no opposition in the ideas expressed, his big words
      wasted on little things, his harsh inversions, so widely different from
      those graceful and easy inversions which give variety, spirit, and
      sweetness to the expression of our great old writers, all these
      peculiarities have been imitated by his admirers and parodied by his
      assailants, till the public has become sick of the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith said to him, very wittily and very justly, &ldquo;If you were to
      write a fable about little fishes, doctor, you would make the little
      fishes talk like whales.&rdquo; No man surely ever had so little talent
      for personation as Johnson. Whether he wrote in the character of a
      disappointed legacy-hunter or an empty town fop, of a crazy virtuoso or a
      flippant coquette, he wrote in the same pompous and unbending style. His
      speech, like Sir Piercy Shafton&rsquo;s Euphuistic eloquence, bewrayed him
      under every disguise. Euphelia and Rhodoclea talk as finely as Imlac the
      poet, or Seged, Emperor of Ethiopia. The gay Cornelia describes her
      reception at the country-house of her relations, in such terms as these:
      &ldquo;I was surprised, after the civilities of my first reception, to
      find, instead of the leisure and tranquillity which a rural life always
      promises, and, if well conducted, might always afford, a confused wildness
      of care, and a tumultuous hurry of diligence, by which every face was
      clouded, and every motion agitated.&rdquo; The gentle Tranquica informs
      us, that she &ldquo;had not passed the earlier part of life without the
      flattery of courtship, and the joys of triumph; but had danced the round
      of gaiety amidst the murmurs of envy and <span class="pagenum">425</span><a
      name="link425" id="link425"></a>the gratulations of applause, had been
      attended from pleasure to pleasure by the great, the sprightly, and the
      vain, and had seen her regard solicited by the obsequiousness of
      gallantry, the gaiety of wit, and the timidity of love.&rdquo; Surely Sir
      John Falstaff himself did not wear his petticoats with a worse grace. The
      reader may well cry out, with honest Sir Hugh Evans, &ldquo;I like not
      when a &lsquo;oman has a great peard: I spy a great peard under her
      muffler.&rdquo; (1)

      We had something more to say. But our article is already too long; and we
      must close it. We would fain part in good humour from the hero, from the
      biographer, and even from the editor, who, ill as he has performed his
      task, has at least this claim to our gratitude, that he has induced us to
      read Boswell&rsquo;s book again. As we close it, the club-room is before
      us, and the table on which stands the omelet for Nugent, and the lemons
      for Johnson. There are assembled those heads which live for ever on the
      canvass of Reynolds. There are the spectacles of Burke and the tall thin
      form of Langton, the courtly sneer of Beauclerk and the beaming smile of
      Garrick, Gibbon tapping his snuff-box and Sir Joshua with his trumpet in
      his ear. In the foreground is that strange figure which is as familiar to
      us as the figures of those among whom we have been brought up, the
      gigantic body, the huge massy face, seamed with the scars of disease, the
      brown coat, the black worsted stockings, the grey wig with the scorched
      foretop, the dirty hands, the nails bitten and pared to the quick. We see
      the eyes and mouth moving with convulsive twitches; we see the heavy

      What a singular destiny has been that of this remarkable man! To be

      receive from his contemporaries that full homage which men of genius have
      in general received only from posterity! To be more intimately known to
      posterity than other men are known to their contemporaries! That kind of
      fame which is commonly the most transient is, in his case, the most
      durable. The reputation of those writings, which he probably expected to
      be immortal, is every day fading; while those peculiarities of manner and
      that careless table-talk the memory of which, he probably thought, would
      die with him, are likely to be remembered as long as the English language
      is spoken in any quarter of the globe.

      this book with great pleasure, though not exactly with that kind of
      pleasure which we had expected. We had hoped that Lord Nugent would have
      been able to collect, from family papers and local traditions, much new
      and interesting information respecting the life and character of the
      renowned leader of the Long Parliament, the first of those great English
      commoners whose plain addition of Mister has, to our ears, a more majestic
      sound than the proudest of the feudal titles. In this hope we have been
      disappointed; but assuredly not from any want of zeal or diligence on the
      part of the noble biographer. Even at Hampden, there are, it seems, no
      important papers relating to the most illustrious proprietor of that
      ancient domain. The most valuable memorials of him which still exist,
      belong to the family of his friend, Sir John Eliot. Lord Eliot has
      furnished the portrait which is engraved for this work, together with some
      very interesting letters. The portrait is undoubtedly an original, and
      probably the only original now in existence. The intellectual forehead,
      the mild penetration of the eye, and the inflexible resolution expressed

      of the month, sufficiently guarantee the likeness. We shall probably make
      some extracts from the letters. They contain almost all the new
      information that Lord Nugent has been able to procure respecting the
      private pursuits of the great man whose memory he worships with an
      enthusiastic, but not extravagant, veneration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public life of Hampden is surrounded by no obscurity. His history,
      more particularly from the year 1640 to his death, is the history of
      England. These Memoirs must be considered as Memoirs of the history of
      England; and, as such, they well deserve to be attentively perused. They
      contain some curious facts which, to us at least, are new, much spirited
      narrative, many judicious remarks, and much eloquent declamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not sure that even the want of information respecting the private
      character of Hampden is not in itself a circumstance as strikingly
      characteristic as any which the most minute chronicler, O&rsquo;Meara,
      Mrs. Thrale, or Boswell himself, ever recorded concerning their heroes.
      The celebrated Puritan leader is an almost solitary instance of a great
      man who neither sought nor shunned greatness, who found glory only because
      glory lay in the plain path of duty. During more than forty years he was
      known to his country neighbours as a gentleman of cultivated mind, of high
      principles, of polished address, happy in his family, and active in the
      discharge of local duties; and to political men, as an honest,
      industrious, and sensible member of Parliament, not eager to display his
      talents, stanch to his party, and attentive to the interests of his
      constituents. A great and terrible crisis came. A direct attack was made
      by an arbitrary government on a sacred right of Englishmen, on a right
      which was the <span class="pagenum">429</span><a
      name="link429_rdquo_________id_" id="link429_rdquo_________id_"></a>chief
      security for all their other rights. The nation looked round for a
      defender. Calmly and unostentatiously the plain Buckinghamshire Esquire
      placed himself at the head of his countrymen, and right before the face
      and across the path of tyranny. The times grew darker and more troubled.
      Public service, perilous, arduous, delicate, was required; and to every
      service the Intellect and the courage of this wonderful man were found
      fully equal. He became a debater of the first order, a most dexterous
      manager of the House of Commons, a negotiator, a soldier. He governed a
      fierce and turbulent assembly, abounding in able men, as easily as he had
      governed his family. He showed himself as competent to direct a campaign
      as to conduct the business of the petty sessions. We can scarcely express
      the admiration which we feel for a mind so great, and, at the same time,
      so healthful and so well proportioned, so willingly contracting itself to
      the humblest duties, so easily expanding itself to the Highest, so
      contented in repose, so powerful in action. Almost every part of this
      virtuous and blameless life which is not hidden from us in modest privacy
      is a precious and splendid portion of our national history. Had the
      private conduct of Hampden afforded the slightest pretence for censure, he
      would have been assailed by the same blind malevolence which, in defiance
      of the clearest proofs, still continues to call Sir John Eliot an
      assassin. Had there been even any weak part in the character of Hampden,
      had his manners been in any respect open to ridicule, we may be sure that
      no mercy would have been shown to him by the writers of Charles&rsquo;s
      faction. Those writers have carefully preserved every little circumstance
      which could tend to make their opponents odious or contemptible. <span
      class="pagenum">430</span><a name="link430_rdquo_________id_"
      id="link430_rdquo_________id_"></a>They have made themselves merry with
      the cant of injudicious zealots. They have told us that Pym broke down in
      a speech, that Ireton had his nose pulled by Hollis, that the Earl of
      Northumberland cudgelled Henry Marten, that St. John&rsquo;s manners were
      sullen, that Vane had an ugly face, that Cromwell had a red nose. But
      neither the artful Clarendon nor the scurrilous Denham could venture to
      throw the slightest imputation on the morals or the manners of Hampden.
      What was the opinion entertained respecting him by the best men of his
      time, we learn from Baxter. That eminent person, eminent not only for his
      piety and his fervid devotional eloquence, but for his moderation, his
      knowledge of political affairs, and his skill in judging of characters,
      declared in the Saint&rsquo;s Rest that one of the pleasures which he
      hoped to enjoy in heaven was the society of Hampden. In the editions
      printed after the Restoration, the name of Hampden was omitted. &ldquo;But
      I must tell the reader,&rdquo; says Baxter, &ldquo;that I did blot it out,
      not as changing my opinion of the person.... Mr. John Hampden was one that
      friends and enemies acknowledged to be most eminent for prudence, piety,
      and peaceable counsels, having the most universal praise of any gentleman
      that I remember of that age. I remember a moderate, prudent, aged
      gentleman, far from him, but acquainted with him, whom I have heard
      saying, that if he might choose what person he would be then in the world,
      he would be John Hampden.&rdquo; We cannot but regret that we have not
      fuller memorials of a man who, after passing through the most severe
      temptations by which human virtue can be tried, after acting a most
      conspicuous part in a revolution and a civil war, could yet deserve such
      praise as this from such authority. <span class="pagenum">431</span><a
      name="link431" id="link431"></a>Yet the want of memorials is surely the
      best proof that hatred itself could find no blemish on his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of his early life is soon told. He was the head of a family
      which had been settled in Buckinghamshire before the Conquest. Part of the
      estate which he inherited had been bestowed by Edward the Confessor on
      Baldwyn de Hampden, whose name seems to indicate that he was one of the
      Norman favourites of the last Saxon king. During the contest between the
      houses of York and Lancaster, the Hampdens adhered to the party of the Red
      Rose, and were, consequently, persecuted by Edward the Fourth, and
      favoured by Henry the Seventh. Under the Tudors, the family was great and
      flourishing. Griffith Hampden, high sheriff of Buckinghamshire,
      entertained Elizabeth with great magnificence at his seat. His son,
      William Hampden, sate in the Parliament which that Queen summoned in the
      year 1593. William married Elizabeth Cromwell, aunt of the celebrated man
      who afterwards governed the British islands with more than regal power;
      and from this marriage sprang John Hampden.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was born in 1594. In 1597 his father died, and left him heir to a very
      large estate. After passing some years at the grammar school of Thame,
      young Hampden was sent, at fifteen, to Magdalene College, in the
      University of Oxford. At nineteen, he was admitted a student of the Inner
      Temple, where he made himself master of the principles of the English law.
      In 1619, he married Elizabeth Symeon, a lady to whom he appears to have
      been fondly attached. In the following year he was returned to parliament
      by a borough which has in our time obtained a miserable celebrity, the
      borough of Grampound. <span class="pagenum">432</span><a
      name="link432_rdquo_________id_" id="link432_rdquo_________id_"></a>Of his
      private life during his early years little is known beyond what Clarendon
      has told us. &ldquo;In his entrance into the world,&rdquo; says that great
      historian, &ldquo;he indulged himself in all the license in sports, and
      exercises, and company, which were used by men of the most jolly
      conversation.&rdquo; A remarkable change, however, passed on his
      character. &ldquo;On a sudden,&rdquo; says Clarendon, &ldquo;from a life
      of great pleasure and license, he retired to extraordinary sobriety and
      strictness, to a more reserved and melancholy society.&rdquo; It is
      probable that this change took place when Hampden was about twenty-five
      years old. At that age he was united to a woman whom he loved and
      esteemed. At that age he entered into political life. A mind so happily
      constituted as his would naturally, under such circumstances, relinquish
      the pleasures of dissipation for domestic enjoyments and public duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      His enemies have allowed that he was a man in whom virtue showed itself in
      its mildest and least austere form. With the morals of a Puritan, he had
      the manners of an accomplished courtier. Even after the change in his
      habits, &ldquo;he preserved,&rdquo; says Clarendon, &ldquo;his own natural
      cheerfulness and vivacity, and, above all, a flowing courtesy to all men.&rdquo;
      These qualities distinguished him from most of the members of his sect and
      his party, and, in the great crisis in which he afterwards took a
      principal part, were of scarcely less service to the country than his keen
      sagacity and his dauntless courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In January, 1621, Hampden took his seat in the House of Commons. His
      mother was exceedingly desirous that her son should obtain a peerage. His
      family, his possessions, and his personal accomplishments were such, as
      would, in any age, have justified <span class="pagenum">433</span><a
      name="link433" id="link433"></a>him in pretending to that honour. But in
      the reign of James the First there was one short cut to the House of
      Lords. It was but to ask, to pay, and to have. The sale of titles was
      carried on as openly as the sale of boroughs in our times. Hampden turned
      away with contempt from the degrading honours with which his family
      desired to see him invested, and attached himself to the party which was
      in opposition to the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about this time, as Lord Nugent has justly remarked, that
      parliamentary opposition began to take a regular form. From a very early
      age, the English had enjoyed a far larger share of liberty than had fallen
      to the lot of any neighbouring people. How it chanced that a country
      conquered and enslaved by invaders, a country of which the soil had been
      portioned out among foreign adventurers and of which the laws were written
      in a foreign tongue, a country given over to that worst tyranny, the
      tyranny of caste over caste, should have become the seat of civil liberty,
      the object of the admiration and envy of surrounding states, is one of the
      most obscure problems in the philosophy of history. But the fact is
      certain. Within a century and a half after the Norman conquest, the Great
      Charter was conceded. Within two centuries after the Conquest, the first
      House of Commons met. Froissart tells us, what indeed his whole narrative
      sufficiently proves, that, of all the nations of the fourteenth century,
      the English were the least disposed to endure oppression. &ldquo;C&rsquo;est
      le plus p√©rilleux peuple qui soit au monde, et plus outrageux et
      orgueilleux.&rdquo; The good canon probably did not perceive that all the
      prosperity and internal peace which this dangerous people enjoyed were the
      fruits of the spirit which he designates as proud <span class="pagenum">434</span><a
      name="link434" id="link434"></a>and outrageous. He has, however, borne
      ample testimony to the effect, though he was not sagacious enough to trace
      it to its cause. &ldquo;En le royaume d&rsquo;Angleterre,&rdquo; says he,
      &ldquo;toutes gens, laboureurs et marchands, ont appris de vivre en paix,
      et √† mener leurs marchandises paisiblement, et les laboureurs labourer.&rdquo;
      In the fifteenth century, though England was convulsed by the struggle
      between the two branches of the royal family, the physical and moral
      condition of the people continued to improve. Villenage almost wholly
      disappeared. The calamities of war were little felt, except by those who
      bore arms. The oppressions of the government were little felt, except by
      the aristocracy. The institutions of the country, when compared with the
      institutions of the neighbouring kingdoms, seem to have been not
      undeserving of the praises of Fortescue. The government of Edward the
      Fourth, though we call it cruel and arbitrary, was humane and liberal when
      compared with that of Lewis the Eleventh, or that of Charles the Bold.
      Comines, who had lived amidst the wealthy cities of Flanders, and who had
      visited Florence and Venice, had never seen a people so well governed as
      the English. &ldquo;Or selon mon advis,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;entre
      toutes les seigneuries du monde, dont j&rsquo;ay connoissance, ou la chose
      publique est mieulx trait√©e, et ou r√©gn√© moins de violence sur le peuple,
      et ou il n&rsquo;y an uls √©difices abbatus ny d√©molis pour guerre, c&rsquo;est
      Angleterre; et tombe le sort et le malheur sur ceulx qui font la guerre.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      About the close of the fifteenth and the commencement of the sixteenth
      century, a great portion of the influence which the aristocracy had
      possessed passed to the crown. No English king has ever enjoyed such
      absolute power as Henry the Eighth. But while the <span class="pagenum">435</span><a
      name="link435" id="link435"></a>royal prerogatives were acquiring strength
      at the expense of the nobility, two great revolutions took place, destined
      to be the parents of many revolutions, the invention of Printing, and the
      reformation of the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The immediate effect of the Reformation in England was by no means
      favourable to political liberty. The authority which had been exercised by
      the Popes was transferred almost entire to the King. Two formidable powers
      which had often served to check each other were united in a single despot.
      If the system on which the founders of the Church of England acted could
      have been permanent, the Reformation would have been, in a political
      sense, the greatest curse that ever fell on our country. But that system
      carried within it the seeds of its own death. It was possible to transfer
      the name of Head of the Church from Clement to Henry; but it was
      impossible to transfer to the new establishment the veneration which the
      old establishment had inspired. Mankind had not broken one yoke in pieces
      only in order to put on another. The supremacy of the Bishop of Rome had
      been for ages considered as a fundamental principle of Christianity. It
      had for it every thing that could make a prejudice deep and strong,
      venerable antiquity, high authority, general consent. It had been taught
      in the first lessons of the nurse. It was taken for granted in all the
      exhortations of the priest. To remove it was to break innumerable
      associations, and to give a great and perilous shock to the principles.
      Yet this prejudice, strong as it was, could not stand in the great day of
      the deliverance of the human reason. And it was not to be expected that
      the public mind, just after freeing itself by an unexampled effort, from a
      bondage <span class="pagenum">436</span><a name="link436" id="link436"></a>which
      it had endured for ages, would patiently submit to a tyranny which could
      plead no ancient&rsquo;title. Rome had at least prescription on its side.
      But Protestant intolerance, despotism in an upstart sect, infallibility
      claimed by guides who acknowledged that they had passed the greater part
      of their lives in error, restraints imposed on the liberty of private
      judgment at the pleasure of rulers who could vindicate their own
      proceedings only by asserting the liberty of private judgment, these
      things could not long be borne. Those who had pulled down the crucifix
      could not long continue to persecute for the surplice. It required no
      great sagacity to perceive the inconsistency and dishonesty of men who,
      dissenting from almost all Christendom, would suffer none to dissent from
      themselves, who demanded freedom of conscience, yet refused to grant it,
      who execrated persecution, yet persecuted, who urged reason against the
      authority of one opponent, and authority against the reasons of another.
      Bonner acted at least in accordance with his own principles. Cranmer could
      vindicate himself from the charge of being a heretic only by arguments
      which made him out to be a murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the system on which the English Princes acted with respect to
      ecclesiastical affairs for some time after the Reformation was a system
      too obviously unreasonable to be lasting. The public mind moved while the
      government moved, but would not stop where the government stopped. The
      same impulse which had carried millions away from the Church of Rome
      continued to carry them forward in the same direction. As Catholics had
      become Protestants, Protestants became Puritans; and the Tudors and
      Stuarts were as unable to avert the latter change as the Popes had been to
      <span class="pagenum">437</span><a name="link437" id="link437"></a>avert
      the former. The dissenting party increased and became strong under every
      kind of discouragement and oppression. They were a sect. The government
      persecuted them; and they became an opposition. The old constitution of
      England furnished to them the means of resisting the sovereign without
      breaking the law. They were the majority of the House of Commons. They had
      the power of giving or withholding supplies; and, by a judicious exercise
      of this power, they might hope to take from the Church its usurped
      authority over the consciences of men, and from the Crown some part of the
      vast prerogative which it had recently acquired at the expense of the
      nobles and of the Pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faint beginnings of this memorable contest may be discerned early in
      the reign of Elizabeth. The conduct of her last Parliament made it clear
      that one of those great revolutions which policy may guide but cannot stop
      was in progress. It was on the question of monopolies that the House of
      Commons gained its first great victory over the Throne. The conduct of the
      extraordinary woman who then governed England is an admirable study for
      politicians who live in unquiet times. It shows how thoroughly she
      understood the people whom she ruled, and the crisis in which she was
      called to act. What she held she held firmly. What she gave she gave
      graciously. She saw that it was necessary to make a concession to the
      nation; and she made it, not grudgingly, not tardily, not as a matter of
      bargain and sale, not, in a word, as Charles the First would have made it,
      but promptly and cordially. Before a bill could be framed or an address
      presented, she applied a remedy to the evil of which the nation
      complained. She expressed in the <span class="pagenum">438</span><a
      name="link438" id="link438"></a>warmest terms her gratitude to her
      faithful Commons for detecting abuses which interested persons had
      concealed from her. If her successors had inherited her wisdom with her
      crowd, Charles the First might have died of old age, and James the Second
      would never have seen St. Germain&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      She died; and the kingdom passed to one who was, in his own opinion, the
      greatest master of king-craft that ever lived, but who was, in truth, one
      of those kings whom God seems to send for the express purpose of hastening
      revolutions. Of all the enemies of liberty whom Britain has produced, he
      was at once the most harmless and the most provoking. His office resembled
      that of the man who, in a Spanish bullfight, goads the torpid savage to
      fury, by shaking a red rag in the air, and by now and then throwing a
      dart, sharp enough to sting, but too small to injure. The policy of wise
      tyrants has always been to cover their violent acts with popular forms.
      James was always obtruding his despotic theories on his subjects without
      the slightest necessity. His foolish talk exasperated them infinitely more
      than forced loans or benevolences would have done. Yet, in practice, no
      king ever held his prerogatives less tenaciously. He neither gave way
      gracefully to the advancing spirit of liberty nor took vigorous measures
      to stop it, but retreated before it with ludicrous haste, blustering and
      insulting as he retreated. The English people had been governed during
      near a hundred and fifty years by Princes who, whatever might be their
      frailties or their vices, had all possessed great force of character, and
      who, whether beloved or hated, had always been feared. Now, at length, for
      the first time since the day when the sceptre of Henry the Fourth dropped
      <span class="pagenum">439</span><a name="link439" id="link439"></a>from
      the hand of his lethargic grandson, England had a king whom she despised.
    </p>
    <p>
      The follies and vices of the man increased the contempt which was produced
      by the feeble policy of the sovereign. The indecorous gallantries of the
      Court, the habits of gross intoxication in which even the ladies indulged,
      were alone sufficient to disgust a people whose manners were beginning to
      be strongly tinctured with austerity. But these were trifles. Crimes of
      the most frightful kind had been discovered; others were suspected. The
      strange story of the Gowries was not forgotten. The ignominious fondness
      of the King for his minions, the perjuries, the sorceries, the poisonings,
      which his chief favourites had planned within the walls of his palace, the
      pardon which, in direct violation of his duty and of his word, he had
      granted to the mysterious threats of a murderer, made him an object of
      loathing to many of his subjects. What opinion grave and moral persons
      residing at a distance from the Court entertained respecting him, we learn
      from Mrs. Hutchinson&rsquo;s Memoirs. England was no place, the
      seventeenth century no time, for Sporus and Locusta.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not all. The most ridiculous weaknesses seemed to meet in the
      wretched Solomon of Whitehall, pedantry, buffoonery, garrulity, low
      curiosity, the most contemptible personal cowardice. Nature and education
      had done their best to produce a finished specimen of all that a king
      ought not to be. His awkward figure, his rolling eye, his rickety walk,
      his nervous tremblings, his slobbering mouth, his broad Scotch accent,
      were imperfections which might have been found in the best and greatest
      man. Their effect, however, was to make James and his office objects of
      contempt, and to dissolve those associations which had <span
      class="pagenum">440</span><a name="link440" id="link440"></a>been created
      by the noble bearing of preceding mon-arclis, and which were in themselves
      no inconsiderable fence to royalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sovereign whom James most resembled was, we think, Claudius C√¶sar.
      Both had the same feeble vacillating temper, the same childishness, the
      same coarseness, the same poltroonery. Both were men of learning; both
      wrote and spoke, not, indeed, well, but still in a manner in which it
      seems almost incredible that men so foolish should have written or spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The follies and indecencies of James are well described in the words which
      Suetonius uses respecting Claudius:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Multa talia, etiam privatis deformia, nedum prilcipi, neque
      infacundo, neque indocto, immo etiam pertinaciter liberalibus studiis
      dedito.&rdquo; The description given by Suetonius of the manner in which
      the Roman prince transacted business exactly suits the Briton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In comioscendo ac decernendo mira varietate animi fuit, modo
      circumspectus et sagax, modo inconsultus ac pr√¶ceps, nonnunquam frivolus
      amentique similis.&rdquo; Claudius was ruled successively by two bad
      women: James successively by two bad men. Even the description of the
      person of Claudius, which we find in the ancient memoirs, might, in many
      points, serve for that of James. &ldquo;Ceterum et ingredientem
      destituebant poplit√©s minus firmi, et remisse quid vel serio agentem multa
      dehonestabant, risus indecens, ira turpior, spumante rictu, pr√¶terea
      lingu√¶ titubantia.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Parliament which James had called soon after his accession had been
      refractory. His second Parliament, called in the spring of 1614, had been
      more refractory still. It had been dissolved after a session of two
      months; and during six years the King had governed without having recourse
      to the legislature. <span class="pagenum">441</span><a
      name="link441_rdquo_________id_" id="link441_rdquo_________id_"></a>During
      those six years, melancholy and disgraceful events, at home and abroad,
      had followed one another in rapid succession; the divorce of Lady Essex,
      the murder of Overbury, the elevation of Villiers, the pardon of Somerset,
      the disgrace of Coke, the execution of Raleigh, the battle of Prague, the
      invasion of the Palatinate by Spinola, the ignominious flight of the
      son-in-law of the English king, the depression of the Protestant interest
      all over the continent. All the extraordinary modes by which James could
      venture to raise money had been tried. His necessities were greater than
      ever; and he was compelled to summon the Parliament in which Hampden first
      appeared as a public man.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Parliament lasted about twelve months. During that time it visited
      with deserved punishment several of those who, during the preceding six
      years, had enriched themselves by peculation and monopoly. Michell, one of
      the grasping patentees who had purchased of the favourite the power of
      robbing the nation, was fined and imprisoned for life. Mompesson, the
      original, it is said, of Massinger&rsquo;s Overreach, was outlawed and
      deprived of his ill gotten wealth. Even Sir Edward Villiers, the brother
      of Buckingham, found it convenient to leave England. A greater name is to
      be added to the ignominious list. By this Parliament was brought to
      justice that illustrious philosopher whose memory genius has half redeemed
      from the infamy due to servility, to ingratitude, and to corruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      After redressing internal grievances, the Commons proceeded to take into
      consideration the state of Europe. The King flew into a rage with them for
      meddling with such matters, and, with characteristic <span class="pagenum">442</span><a
      name="link442" id="link442"></a>judgment, drew them into a controversy
      about the origin of their House and of its privileges. When he found that
      he could not convince them, he dissolved them in a passion, and sent some
      of the leaders of the Opposition to ruminate on his logic in prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the time which elapsed between this dissolution and the meeting of
      the next Parliament, took place the celebrated negotiation respecting the
      Infanta. The would-be despot was unmercifully browbeaten. The would-be
      Solomon was ridiculously overreached. Steenie, in spite of the begging and
      sobbing of his dear dad and gossip, carried off baby Charles in triumph to
      Madrid. The sweet lads, as James called them, came back safe, but without
      their errand. The great master of king-craft, in looking for a Spanish
      match, had found a Spanish war. In February, 1624, a Parliament met,
      during the whole sitting of which, James was a mere puppet in the hands of
      his baby, and of his poor slave and dog. The Commons were disposed to
      support the King in the vigorous policy which his favourite urged him to
      adopt. But they were not disposed to place any confidence in their feeble
      sovereign and his dissolute courtiers, or to relax in their efforts to
      remove public grievances. They therefore lodged the money which they voted
      for the war in the hands of Parliamentary Commissioners. They impeached
      the treasurer, Lord Middlesex, for corruption, and they passed a bill by
      which patents of monopoly were declared illegal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hampden did not, during the reign of James, take any prominent part in
      public affairs. It is certain, however, that he paid great attention to
      the details of Parliamentary business, and to the local interests of his
      own country. It was in a great measure owing to <span class="pagenum">443</span><a
      name="link443" id="link443"></a>his exertions that Wendover and some other
      boroughs on which the popular party could depend recovered the elective
      franchise, in spite of the opposition of the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The health of the King had for some time been declining. On the
      twenty-seventh of March, 1025, he expired. Under his weak rule, the spirit
      of liberty had grown strong, and had become equal to a great contest. The
      contest was brought on by the policy cf his successor. Charles bore no
      resemblance to his father. He was not a driveller, or a pedant, or a
      buffoon, or a coward. It would be absurd to deny that he was a scholar and
      a gentleman, a man of exquisite taste in the fine arts, a man of strict
      morals in private life. His talents for business were respectable; his
      demeanour was kingly. But he was false, imperious, obstinate,
      narrow-minded, ignorant of the temper of his people, unobservant of the
      signs of his times. The whole principle of his government was resistance
      to public opinion; nor did he make any real concession to that opinion
      till it mattered not whether he resisted or conceded, till the nation,
      which had long ceased to love him or to trust him, had at last ceased to
      fear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first Parliament met in June, 1625. Hampden sat in it as burgess for
      Wendover. The King wished for money. The commons wished for the redress of
      grievances. The war, however, could not be carried on without funds. The
      plan of the Opposition was, it should seem, to dole out supplies by small
      sums, in order to prevent a speedy dissolution. They gave the King two
      subsidies only, and proceeded to complain that his ships had been employed
      against the Huguenots in France, and to petition in behalf of the Puritans
      who were persecuted in England. The King <span class="pagenum">444</span><a
      name="link444" id="link444"></a>dissolved them, and raised money by
      Letters under his Privy Seal. The supply fell far short of what he needed;
      and, in the spring of 1620, he called together another Parliament. In this
      Parliament, Hampden again sat for Wendover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Commons resolved to grant a very liberal supply, but to defer the
      final passing of the act for that purpose till the grievances of the
      nation should be redressed. The struggle which followed far exceeded in
      violence any that had yet taken place. The Commons impeached Buckingham.
      The King threw the managers of the impeachment into prison. The Commons
      denied the right of the King to levy tonnage and poundage without their
      consent. The King dissolved them. They put forth a remonstrance. The King
      circulated a declaration vindicating his measures, and committed some of
      the most distinguished members of the Opposition to close custody. Money
      was raised by a forced loan, which was apportioned among the people
      according to the rate at which they had been respectively assessed to the
      last subsidy. On this occasion it was, that Hampden made his first stand
      for the fundamental principle of the English constitution. He positively
      refused to lend a farthing. He was required to give his reasons. He
      answered, &ldquo;that he could be content to lend as well as others, but
      feared to draw upon himself that curse in Magna Charta which should be
      read twice a year against those who infringe it.&rdquo; For this spirited
      answer, the Privy Council committed him close prisoner to the Gate House.
      After some time, he was again brought up; but he persisted in his refusal,
      and was sent to a place of confinement in Hampshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The government went on, oppressing at home, and blundering in all its
      measures abroad. A war was <span class="pagenum">445</span><a
      name="link445" id="link445"></a>foolishly undertaken against France, and
      more foolishly conducted. Buckingham led an expedition against Rhe, and
      failed ignominiously. In the mean time soldiers were billeted on the
      people. Crimes of which ordinary justice should have taken cognisance were
      punished by martial law. Near eighty gentlemen were imprisoned for
      refusing to contribute to the forced loan. The lower people who showed any
      signs of insubordination were dressed into the fleet, or compelled to
      serve in the army. Money, however, came in slowly; and the King was
      compelled to summon another Parliament. In the hope of conciliating his
      subjects, he set at liberty the persons who had been imprisoned for
      refusing to comply with his unlawful demands. Hampden regained his
      freedom, and was immediately reelected burgess for Wendover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in 1628 the Parliament met. During its first session, the Commons
      prevailed on the King, after many delays and much equivocation, to give,
      in return for five subsidies, his full and solemn assent to that
      celebrated instrument, the second great charter of the liberties of
      England, known by the name of the Petition of Right. By agreeing to this
      act, the King bound himself to raise no taxes without the consent of
      Parliament, to imprison no man except by legal process, to billet no more
      soldiers on the people, and to leave the cognisance of offences to the
      ordinary tribunals.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the summer, this memorable Parliament was prorogued. It met again in
      January, 1629. Buckingham was no more. That weak, violent, and dissolute
      adventurer, who, with no talents or acquirements but those of a mere
      courtier, had, in a great crisis of foreign and domestic politics,
      ventured on the part of <span class="pagenum">446</span><a
      name="link446_rdquo_________id_" id="link446_rdquo_________id_"></a>prime
      minister, had fallen, during the recess of Parliament, by the hand of an
      assassin. Both before and after his death the war had been feebly and
      unsuccessfully conducted. The King had continued, in direct violation of
      the Petition of Righ, to raise tonnage and poundage without the consent of
      Parliament. The troops had again been billeted on the people; and it was
      clear to the Commons that the five subsidies which they had given as the
      price of the national liberties had been given in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met accordingly in no complying humour. They took into their most
      serious consideration the measures of the government concerning tonnage
      and poundage. They summoned the officers of the custom-house to their bar.
      They interrogated the barons of the exchequer. They committed one of the
      sheriffs of London. Sir John Eliot, a distinguished member of the
      Opposition, and an intimate friend of Hampden, proposed a resolution
      condemning the unconstitutional imposition. The Speaker said that the King
      had commanded him to put no such question to the vote. This decision
      produced the most violent burst of feeling ever seen within the walls of
      Parliament. Hayman remonstrated vehemently against the disgraceful
      language which had been heard from the chair. Eliot dashed the paper which
      contained his resolution on the floor of the House. Valentine and Hollis
      held the Speaker down in his seat by main force, and read the motion
      amidst the loudest shouts. The door was locked. The key was laid on the
      table. Black Rod knocked for admittance in vain. After passing several
      strong resolutions, the House adjourned. On the day appointed for its
      meeting it was dissolved by the King, and several of its most eminent
      members, among <span class="pagenum">447</span><a
      name="link447_rdquo_________id_" id="link447_rdquo_________id_"></a>whom
      were Hollis and Sir John Eliot, were committed to prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Hampden had as yet taken little part in the debates of the House,
      he had been a member of many very important committees, and had read and
      written much concerning the law of Parliament. A manuscript volume uf
      Parliamentary cases, which is still in existence, contains many extracts
      from his notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now retired to the duties and pleasures of a rural life. During the
      eleven years which followed the dissolution of the Parliament of 1628, he
      resided at his seat in one of the most beautiful parts of the county of
      Buckingham. The house, which has since his time been greatly altered, and
      which is now, we believe, almost entirely neglected, was an old English
      mansion, built in the days of the Plantagenets and the Tudors. It stood on
      the brow of a hill which overlooks a narrow valley. The extensive woods
      which surround it were pierced by long avenues. One of those avenues the
      grandfather of the great statesman had cut for the approach of Elizabeth;
      and the opening, which is still visible for many miles, retains the name
      of the Queen&rsquo;s Gap. In this delightful retreat, Hampden passed
      several years, performing with great activity all the duties of a landed
      gentleman and a magistrate, and amusing himself with books and with field
      sports.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not in his retirement unmindful of his persecuted friends. In
      particular, he kept up a close correspondence with Sir John Eliot, who was
      confined in the Tower. Lord Nugent has published several of the Letters.
      We may perhaps be fanciful; but it seems to us that every one of them is
      an admirable illustration <span class="pagenum">448</span><a
      name="link448_rdquo_________id_" id="link448_rdquo_________id_"></a>of
      some part of the character of Hampden which Clarendon has drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The correspondence relates to the two sons of Sir John Eliot. These young
      men were wild and unsteady; and their father, who was now separated from
      them, was naturally anxious about their conduct. He at length resolved to
      send one of them to France, and the other to serve a campaign in the Low
      Countries. The letter which we subjoin shows that Hampden, though rigorous
      towards himself, was not uncharitable towards others, and that his
      puritanism was perfectly compatible with the sentiments and the tastes of
      an accomplished gentleman. It also illustrates admirably what has been
      said of him by Clarendon: &ldquo;He was of that rare affability and temper
      in debate, and of that seeming humility and submission of judgment, as if
      he brought no opinion of his own with him, but a desire of information and
      instruction. Yet he had so subtle a way of interrogating, and, under cover
      of doubts, insinuating his objections, that he infused his own opinions
      into those from whom he pretended to learn and receive them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter runs thus: &ldquo;I am so perfectly acquainted with your clear
      insight into the dispositions of men, and ability to fit them with courses
      suitable, that, had you bestowed sons of mine as you have done your own,
      my judgment durst hardly have called it into question, especially when, in
      laying the design, you have prevented the objections to be made against
      it. For if Mr. Richard Eliot will, in the intermissions of action, add
      study to practice, and adorn that lively spirit with flowers of
      contemplation, he will raise our expectations of another Sir Edward Vere,
      that had this character&mdash;all summer in the field, all winter in his
      study&mdash;<span class="pagenum">449</span><a name="link449" id="link449"></a>in
      whose fall fame makes this kingdom a great loser; and, having taken this
      resolution from counsel with the highest wisdom, as I doubt not you have,
      I hope and pray that the same power will crown it with a blessing
      answerable to our wish. The way you take with my other friend shows you to
      be none of the Bishop of Exeter&rsquo;s converts; (1) of whose mind
      neither am I superstitiously. But had my opinion been asked, I should, as
      vulgar conceits use to do, have showed my power rather to raise objections
      than to answer them. A temper between France and Oxford, might have taken
      away his scruples, with more advantage to his years......... For although
      he be one of those that, if his age were looked for in no other book but
      that of the mind, would be found no ward if you should die to-morrow, yet
      it is a great hazard, methinks, to see so sweet a disposition guarded with
      no more, amongst a people whereof many make it their religion to be
      superstitious in impiety, and their behaviour to be affected in ill
      manners. But God, who only knoweth the periods of life and opportunities
      to come, hath designed him, I hope, for his own service betime, and
      stirred up your providence to husband him so early for great affairs. Then
      shall he be sure to find Him in France that Abraham did in Sechem and
      Joseph in Egypt, under whose wing alone is perfect safety.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John Eliot employed himself, during his imprisonment, in writing a
      treatise on government, which he transmitted to his friend. Hampden&rsquo;s
      criticisms are strikingly characteristic. They are written with all that
      &ldquo;flowing courtesy&rdquo; which is ascribed to him by Clarendon. The
      objections are insinuated with so
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) Hall, Bishop of Exeter, had written strongly, both in
     verse and in prose, against the fashion of sending young men
     of quality to travel.
</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">450</span><a name="link450" id="link450"></a>much
      delicacy that they could scarcely gall the most irritable author. We see
      too how highly Hampden valued in the writings of others that conciseness
      which was one of the most striking peculiarities of his own eloquence. Sir
      John Eliot&rsquo;s style was, it seems, too diffuse, and it is impossible
      not to admire the skill with which this is suggested. &ldquo;The piece,&rdquo;
      says Hampden, &ldquo;is as complete an image of the pattern as can be
      drawn by lines, a lively character of a large mind, the subject, method,
      and expression, excellent and homogeneal, and, to say truth, sweetheart,
      somewhat exceeding my commendations. My words cannot render them to the
      life. Yet, to show my ingenuity rather than wit, would not a less model
      have given a full representation of that subject, not by diminution but by
      contraction of parts? I desire to learn. I dare not say. The variations
      upon each particular seem many; all, I confess, excellent. The fountain
      was full, the channel narrow; that may be the cause; or that the author
      resembled Virgil, who made more verses by many than he intended to write.
      To extract a just number, had I seen all his, I could easily have bid him
      make fewer; but if he had bade me tell him which he should have spared, I
      had been posed.&rdquo; This is evidently the writing not only of a man of
      good sense and natural good taste, but of a man of literary habits. Of the
      studies of Hampden little is known. But, as it was at one time in
      contemplation to give him the charge of the education of the Prince of
      Wales, it cannot be doubted that his acquirements were considerable.
      Davila, it is said, was one of his favourite writers. The moderation of
      Davila&rsquo;s opinions and the perspicuity and manliness of his style
      could not but recommend him to so judicious a reader. <span class="pagenum">451</span><a
      name="link451_rdquo_________id_" id="link451_rdquo_________id_"></a>It is
      not improbable that the parallel between France and England, the Huguenots
      and the Puritans, had struck the mind of Hampden, and that he
      already-found within himself powers not unequal to the lofty part of
      Coligni.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was engaged in these pursuits, a heavy domestic calamity fell on
      him. His wife, who had borne him nine children, died in the summer of
      1634. She lies in the parish church of Hampden, close to the manor-house.
      The tender and energetic language of her epitaph still attests the
      bitterness of her husband&rsquo;s sorrow, and the consolation which he
      found in a hope full of immortality.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, the aspect of public affairs grew darker and darker. The
      health of Eliot had sunk under an unlawful imprisonment of several years.
      The brave sufferer refused to purchase liberty, though liberty would to
      him have been life, by recognising the authority which had confined him.
      In consequence of the representations of his physicians, the severity of
      restraint was somewhat relaxed. But it was in vain. He languished and
      expired a martyr to that good cause for which his friend Hampden was
      destined to meet a more brilliant, but not a more honourable death.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the promises of the King were violated without scruple or shame. The
      Petition of Right, to which he had, in consideration of monies duly
      numbered, given a solemn assent, was set at nought. Taxes were raised by
      the royal authority. Patents of monopoly were granted. The old usages of
      feudal times were made pretexts for harassing the people with exactions
      unknown during many years. The Puritans were persecuted with cruelty
      worthy of the Holy Office. They were forced to fly from the country. They
      <span class="pagenum">452</span><a name="link452" id="link452"></a>were
      imprisoned. They were whipped. Their ears were cut off. Their noses were
      slit. Their cheeks were branded with red-hot iron. But the cruelty of the
      oppressor could not tire out the fortitude of the victims. The mutilated
      defenders of liberty again defied the vengeance of the Star Chamber, came
      back with undiminished resolution to the place of their glorious infamy,
      and manfully presented the stumps of their ears to be grubbed out by the
      hangman&rsquo;s knife. The hardy sect grew up and flourished in spite of
      every thing that seemed likely to stunt it, struck its roots deep into a
      barren soil, and spread its branches wide to an inclement sky. The
      multitude thronged round Prynne in the pillory with more respect than they
      paid to Mainwaring in the pulpit, and treasured up the rags which the
      blood of Burton had soaked, with a veneration such as mitres and surplices
      had ceased to inspire.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the misgovernment of this disastrous period Charles himself is
      principally responsible. After the death of Buckingham, he seems to have
      been his own prime minister. He had, however, two counsellors who seconded
      him, or went beyond him, in intolerance and lawless violence, the one a
      superstitious driveller, as honest as a vile temper would suffer him to
      be, the other a man of great valour and capacity, but licentious,
      faithless, corrupt, and cruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never were faces more strikingly characteristic of the individuals to whom
      they belonged, than those of Laud and Strafford, as they still remain
      portrayed by the most skilful hand of that age. The mean forehead, the
      pinched features, the peering eyes, of the prelate, suit admirably with
      his disposition. They mark him out as a lower kind of Saint Dominic,
      differing <span class="pagenum">453</span><a name="link453" id="link453"></a>from
      the fierce and gloomy enthusiast who founded the Inquisition, as we might
      imagine the familiar imp of a spiteful witch to differ from an archangel
      of darkness. When we read His Grace&rsquo;s judgments, when we read the
      report which he drew up, setting forth that he had sent some separatists
      to prison, and imploring the royal aid against others, we feel a movement
      of indignation. We turn to his Diary, and we are at once as cool as
      contempt can make us. There we learn how his picture fell down, and how
      fearful he was lest the fall should be an omen; how he dreamed that the
      Duke of Buckingham came to bed to him, that King James walked past him,
      that he saw Thomas Flaxney in green garments, and the Bishop of Worcester
      with his shoulders wrapped in linen. In the early part of 1627, the sleep
      of this great ornament of the church seems to have been much disturbed. On
      the fifth of January, he saw a merry old man with a wrinkled countenance,
      named Grove, lying on the ground. On the fourteenth of the same memorable
      month, he saw the Bishop of Lincoln jump on a horse and ride away. A lay
      or two after this he dreamed that he gave the King drink in a silver cup,
      and that the King refused it, and called for glass. Then he dreamed that
      he had turned Papist; of all his dreams the only one, we suspect, which
      came through the gate of horn. But of these visions our favourite is that
      which, as he has recorded, he enjoyed on the night of Friday, the ninth of
      February, 1627. &ldquo;I dreamed,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that I had the
      scurvy; and that forthwith all my teeth became loose. There was one in
      especial in my lower jaw, which I could scarcely keep in with my finger
      till I had called for help.&rdquo; Here was a man to have the
      superintendence of the opinions of a great nation! <span class="pagenum">454</span><a
      name="link454_rdquo_________id_" id="link454_rdquo_________id_"></a>But
      Wentworth,&mdash;who ever names him without thinking of those harsh dark
      features, ennobled by their expression into more than the majesty of an
      antique Jupiter; of that brow, that eye, that cheek, that lip, wherein, as
      in a chronicle, are written the events of many stormy and disastrous
      years, high enterprise accomplished, frightful dangers braved, power
      unsparingly exercised, suffering unshrinkingly borne; of that fixed look,
      so full of severity, of mournful anxiety, of deep thought, of dauntless
      resolution, which seems at once to forebode and to defy a terrible fate,
      as it lowers on us from the living canvass of Vandyke? Even at this day
      the haughty earl overawes posterity as he overawed his contemporaries, and
      excites the same interest when arraigned before the tribunal of history
      which he excited at the bar of the House of Lords. In spite of ourselves,
      we sometimes feel towards his memory a certain relenting similar to that
      relenting which his defence, as Sir John Denham tells us, produced in
      Westminster Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      This great, brave, bad man entered the House of Commons at the same time
      with Hampden, and took the same side with Hampden. Both were among the
      richest and most powerful commoners in the kingdom. Both were equally
      distinguished by force of character, and by personal courage. Hampden had
      more judgment and sagacity than Wentworth. But no orator of that time
      equalled Wentworth in force and brilliancy of expression. In 1626 both
      these eminent men were committed to prison by the King, Wentworth, who was
      among the leaders of the Opposition, on account of his parliamentary
      conduct, Hampden, who had not as yet taken a prominent part in debate, for
      refusing to pay taxes illegally imposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here their path separated. After the death of <span class="pagenum">455</span><a
      name="link455" id="link455"></a>Buckingham, the King attempted to seduce
      some of the chiefs of the Opposition from their party; and Wentworth was
      among those who yielded to the seduction. He abandoned his associates, and
      hated them ever after with the deadly hatred of a renegade. High titles
      and great employments were heaped upon him. He became Earl of Strafford,
      Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, President of the Council of the North; and he
      employed all his power for the purpose of crushing those liberties of
      which he had been the most distinguished champion. His counsels respecting
      public affairs were fierce and arbitrary. His correspondence with Laud
      abundantly proves that government without parliaments, government by the
      sword, was his favourite scheme. He was angry even that the course of
      justice between man and man should be unrestrained by the royal
      prerogative. He grudged to the Courts of King&rsquo;s Bench and Common
      Pleas even that measure of liberty which the most absolute of the Bourbons
      allowed to the Parliaments of France. In Ireland, where he stood in the
      place of the King, his practice was in strict accordance with his theory.
      He set up the authority of the executive government over that of the
      courts of law. He permitted no person to leave the island without his
      licence. He established vast monopolies for his own private benefit. He
      imposed taxes arbitrarily. He levied them by military force. Some of his
      acts are described even by the partial Clarendon as powerful acts, acts
      which marked a nature excessively imperious, acts which caused dislike and
      terror in sober and dispassionate persons, high acts uf oppression. Upon a
      most frivolous charge, he obtained a capital sentence from a court-martial
      against a man of high rank who had given him offence, he debauched <span
      class="pagenum">456</span><a name="link456" id="link456"></a>the
      daughter-in-law of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and then commanded that
      nobleman to settle his estate according to the wishes of the lady. The
      Chancellor refused. The Lord Lieutenant turned him out of office, and
      threw him into prison. When the violent acts of the Long Parliament are
      blamed, let it not be forgotten from what a tyranny they rescued the
      nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the humbler tools of Charles were Chief-Justice Finch and Noy the
      Attorney-General. Noy had, like Wentworth, supported the cause of liberty
      in Parliament, and had, like Wentworth, abandoned that cause for the sake
      of office. He devised, in conjunction with Finch, a scheme of exaction
      which made the alienation of the people from the throne complete. A writ
      was issued by the King, commanding the city of London to equip and man
      ships of war for his service. Similar writs were sent to the towns along
      the coast. These measures, though they were direct violations of the
      Petition of Right, had at least some show of precedent in their favour.
      But, after a time, the government took a step for which no precedent could
      be pleaded, and sent writs of ship-money to the inland counties. This was
      a stretch of power on which Elizabeth herself had not ventured, even at a
      time when all laws might with propriety have been made to bend to that
      highest law, the safety of the state. The inland counties had not been
      required to furnish ships, or money in the room of ships, even when the
      Armada was approaching our shores. It seemed intolerable that a prince
      who, by assenting to the Petition of Right, had relinquished the power of
      levying ship-money even in the out-ports, should be the first to levy it
      on parts of the kingdom where it had been unknown under the most absolute
      of his predecessors. <span class="pagenum">457</span><a
      name="link457_rdquo_________id_" id="link457_rdquo_________id_"></a>Clarendon
      distinctly admits that this tax was intended, not only for the support of
      the navy, but &ldquo;for a spring and magazine that should have no bottom,
      and for an everlasting supply of all occasions.&rdquo; The nation well
      understood this; and from one end of England to the other the public mind
      was strongly excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckinghamshire was assessed at a ship of four hundred and fifty tons, or
      a sum of four thousand five hundred pounds. The share of the tax which
      fell to Hampden was very small; so small, indeed, that the sheriff was
      blamed for setting so wealthy a man at so low a rate. But, though the sum
      demanded was a trifle, the principle involved was fearfully important.
      Hampden, after consulting the most eminent constitutional lawyers of the
      time, refused to pay the few shillings at which he was assessed, and
      determined to incur all the certain expense, and the probable danger, of
      bringing to a solemn hearing this great controversy between the people and
      the Crown. &ldquo;Till this time,&rdquo; says Clarendon, &ldquo;he was
      rather of reputation in his own country than of public discourse or fame
      in the kingdom; but then he grew the argument of all tongues, every man
      inquiring who and what he was that durst, at his own charge, support the
      liberty and prosperity of the kingdom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the close of the year 1636, this great cause came on in the
      Exchequer Chamber before all the judges of England. The leading counsel
      against the writ was the celebrated Oliver St. John, a man whose temper
      was melancholy, whose manners were reserved, and who was as yet little
      known in Westminster Hall, but whose great talents had not escaped the
      penetrating eye of Hampden. The Attorney-General and Solicitor-General
      appeared for the Crown. <span class="pagenum">458</span><a
      name="link458_rdquo_________id_" id="link458_rdquo_________id_"></a>The
      arguments of the counsel occupied many days; and the Exchequer Chamber
      took a considerable time for deliberation. The opinion of the bench was
      divided. So clearly was the law in favour of Hampden that, though the
      judges held their situations only during the royal pleasure, the majority
      against him was the least possible. Five of the twelve pronounced in his
      favour. The remaining seven gave their voices for the writ.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only effect of this decision was to make the public indignation
      stronger and deeper. &ldquo;The judgment,&rdquo; says Clarendon, &ldquo;proved
      of more advantage and credit to the gentleman condemned than to the King&rsquo;s
      service.&rdquo; The courage which Hampden had shown on this occasion, as
      the same historian tells us, &ldquo;raised his reputation to a great
      height generally throughout the kingdom.&rdquo; Even courtiers and
      crown-lawyers spoke respectfully of him. &ldquo;His carriage,&rdquo; says
      Clarendon, &ldquo;throughout that agitation, was with that rare temper and
      modesty, that they who watched him narrowly to find some advantage against
      his person, to make him less resolute in his cause, were compelled to give
      him a just testimony.&rdquo; But his demeanour, though it impressed Lord
      Falkland with the deepest respect, though it drew forth the praises of
      Solicitor-General Herbert, only kindled into a fiercer flame the
      ever-burning hatred of Strafford. That minister, in his letters to Laud,
      murmured against the lenity with which Hampden was treated. &ldquo;In good
      faith,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;were such men rightly served, they should
      be whipped into their right wits&rdquo; Again he says, &ldquo;I still wish
      Mr. Hampden, and others to his likeness, were well whipped into their
      right senses. And if the rod be so used that it smart not, I am the more
      sorry.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">459</span><a name="link459"
      id="link459"></a>The person of Hampden was now scarcely safe. His prudence
      and moderation had hitherto disappointed those who would gladly have had a
      pretence for sending him to the prison of Eliot. But he knew that the eye
      of a tyrant was on him. In the year 1637 mis-government had reached its
      height. Eight years had passed without a Parliament. The decision of the
      Exchequer Chamber had placed at the disposal of the Crown the whole
      property of the English people. About the time at which that decision was
      pronounced, Prynne, Bastwick, and Burton were mutilated by the sentence of
      the Star Chamber, and sent to rot in remote dungeons. The estate and the
      person of every man who had opposed the court were at its mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hampden determined to leave England. Beyond the Atlantic Ocean, a few of
      the persecuted Puritans had formed, in the wilderness of Connecticut, a
      settlement which has since become a prosperous commonwealth, and which, in
      spite of the lapse of time and of the change of government, still retains
      something of the character given to it by its first founders. Lord Saye
      and Lord Brooke were the original projectors of this scheme of emigration.
      Hampden had been early consulted respecting it. He was now, it appears,
      desirous to withdraw himself beyond the reach of oppressors who, as he
      probably suspected, and as we know, were bent on punishing his manful
      resistance to their tyranny. He was accompanied by his kinsman, Oliver
      Cromwell, over whom he possessed great influence, and in whom he alone had
      discovered, under an exterior appearance of coarseness and extravagance,
      those great and commanding talents which were afterwards the admiration
      and the dread of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cousins took their passage in a vessel which lay <span class="pagenum">460</span><a
      name="link460" id="link460"></a>in the Thames, and which was bound for
      North America. They were actually on board, when an order of council
      appeared, by which the ship was prohibited from sailing. Seven other
      ships, filled with emigrants, were stopped at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hampden and Cromwell remained; and with them remained the Evil Genius of
      the House of Stuart. The tide of public affairs was even now on the turn.
      The King had resolved to change the ecclesiastical constitution of
      Scotland, and to introduce into the public worship of that kingdom
      ceremonies which the great body of the Scots regarded as popish. This
      absurd attempt produced, first discontents, then riots, and at length open
      rebellion. A provisional government was established at Edinburgh, and its
      authority was obeyed throughout the kingdom. This government raised an
      army, appointed a general, and summoned an Assembly of the Kirk. The
      famous instrument called the Covenant was put forth at this time, and was
      eagerly subscribed by the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beginnings of this formidable insurrection were strangely neglected by
      the King and his advisers. But towards the close of the year 1638 the
      danger became pressing. An army was raised; and early in the following
      spring Charles marched northward at the head of a force sufficient, as it
      seemed, to reduce the Covenanters to submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Charles acted at this conjuncture as he acted at every important
      conjuncture throughout his life. After oppressing, threatening, and
      blustering, he hesitated and failed. He was bold in the wrong place, and
      timid in the wrong place. He would have shown his wisdom by being afraid
      before the liturgy was read in St. Giles&rsquo;s church. He put off his
      fear till he had <span class="pagenum">461</span><a name="link461"
      id="link461"></a>reached the Scottish border with his troops. Then, after
      a feeble campaign, he concluded a treaty with the insurgents, and withdrew
      his army. But the terms of the pacification were not observed. Each party
      charged the other with foul play. The Scots refused to disarm. The King
      found great difficulty in re-assembling his forces. His late expedition
      had drained his treasury. The revenues of the next year had been
      anticipated. At another time, he might have attempted to make up the
      deficiency by illegal expedients; but such a course would clearly have
      been dangerous when part of the island was in rebellion. It was necessary
      to call a Parliament. After eleven years of suffering, the voice of the
      nation was to be heard once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In April, 1640, the Parliament met; and the King had another chance of
      conciliating his people. The new House of Commons was, beyond all
      comparison, the least refractory House of Commons that had been known for
      many years. Indeed, we have never been able to understand how, after so
      long a period of mis-government, the representatives of the nation should
      have shown so moderate and so loyal a disposition. Clarendon speaks with
      admiration of their dutiful temper. &ldquo;The House, generally,&rdquo;
      says he, &ldquo;was exceedingly disposed to please the King, and to do him
      service.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could never be hoped,&rdquo; he observes elsewhere, &ldquo;that
      more sober or dispassionate men would ever meet together in that place, or
      fewer who brought ill purposes with them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In this Parliament Hampden took his seat as member for Buckinghamshire,
      and thenceforward, till the day of his death, gave himself up, with
      scarcely any intermission, to public affairs. He took lodgings in <span
      class="pagenum">462</span><a name="link462" id="link462"></a>Gray&rsquo;s
      Inn Lane, near the house occupied by Pym, with whom he lived in habits of
      the closest intimacy. He was now decidedly the most popular man in
      England. The Opposition looked to him as their leader, and the servants of
      the King treated him with marked respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles requested the Parliament to vote an immediate supply, and pledged
      his word that, if they would gratify him in this request, he would
      afterwards give them time to represent their grievances to him. The
      grievances under which the nation suffered were so serious, and the royal
      word had been so shamefully violated, that the Commons could hardly be
      expected to comply with this request. During the first week of the
      session, the minutes of the proceedings against Hampden were laid on the
      table by Oliver St. John, and a committee reported that the case was
      matter of grievance. The King; sent a message to the Commons, offering, if
      they would vote him twelve subsidies, to give up the prerogative of
      ship-money. Many years before, he had received five subsidies in
      consideration of his assent to the Petition of Right. By assenting to that
      petition, he had given up the right of levying ship-money, if he ever
      possessed it. How he had observed the promises made to his third
      Parliament, all England knew; and it was not strange that the Commons
      should be somewhat unwilling to buy from him, over and over again, their
      own ancient and undoubted inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      His message, however, was not unfavourably received. The Commons were
      ready to give a large supply; but they were not disposed to give it in
      exchange for a prerogative of which they altogether denied the existence.
      If they acceded to the proposal <span class="pagenum">463</span><a
      name="link463" id="link463"></a>of the King, they recognised the legality
      of the writs of ship-money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hampden, who was a greater master of parliamentary tactics than any man of
      his time, saw that this was the prevailing feeling, and availed himself of
      it with great dexterity. He moved that the question should be put, &ldquo;Whether
      the House would consent to the proposition made by the King, as contained
      in the message.&rdquo; Hyde interfered, and proposed that the question
      should be divided; that the sense of the House should be taken merely on
      the point whether there should be a supply or no supply; and that the
      manner and the amount should be left for subsequent consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of the House was for granting a supply, but against granting
      it in the manner proposed by the King! If the House had divided on Hampden&rsquo;s
      question, the court would have sustained a defeat; if on Hyde&rsquo;s, the
      court would have gained an apparent victory. Some members called for Hyde&rsquo;s
      motion, others for Hampden&rsquo;s. In the midst of the uproar, the
      secretary of state, Sir Harry Vane, rose and stated that the supply would
      not be accepted unless it were voted according to the tenor of the
      message. Vane was supported by Herbert, the Solicitor-General. Hyde&rsquo;s
      motion was therefore no further pressed, and the debate on the general
      question was adjourned till the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next day the King came down to the House of Lords, and dissolved
      the Parliament with an angry speech. His conduct on this occasion has
      never been defended by any of his apologists. Clarendon condemns it
      severely. &ldquo;No man,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;could imagine what offence
      the Commons had given.&rdquo; The <span class="pagenum">464</span><a
      name="link464" id="link464"></a>offence which they had given is plain.
      They had, indeed, behaved most temperately and most respectfully. But they
      had shown a disposition to redress wrongs and to vindicate the laws; and
      this was enough to make them hateful to a king whom no law could bind, and
      whose whole government was one system of wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nation received the intelligence of the dissolution with sorrow and
      indignation. The only persons to whom this event gave pleasure were those
      few discerning men who thought that the maladies of the state were beyond
      the reach of gentle remedies. Oliver St. John&rsquo;s joy was too great
      for concealment. It lighted up his dark and melancholy features, and made
      him, for the first time, indiscreetly communicative. He told Hyde that
      things must be worse before they could be better, and that the dissolved
      Parliament would never have done all that was necessary. St. John, we
      think, was in the right. No good could then have been done by any
      Parliament which did not fully understand that no confidence could safely
      be placed in the King, and that, while he enjoyed more than the shadow of
      power, the nation would never enjoy more than the shadow of liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Charles had dismissed the Parliament, he threw several members
      of the House of Commons into prison. Ship-money was exacted more
      rigorously than ever; and the Mayor and Sheriffs of London were prosecuted
      before the Star Chamber for slackness in levying it. Wentworth, it is
      said, observed, with characteristic insolence and cruelty, that things
      would never go right till the Aldermen were hanged. Large sums were raised
      by force on those counties in which the troops were quartered. All the
      wretched shifts of a <span class="pagenum">465</span><a
      name="link465_rdquo_________id_" id="link465_rdquo_________id_"></a>beggared
      exchequer were tried. Forced loans were raised. Great quantities of goods
      were bought on long credit and sold for ready-money. A scheme for debasing
      the currency was under consideration. At length, in August, the King again
      marched northward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scots advanced into England to meet him. It is by no means improbable
      that this bold step was taken by the advice of Hampden, and of those with
      whom he acted; and this has been made matter of grave accusation against
      the English Opposition. It is said that to call in the aid of foreigners
      in a domestic quarrel is the worst of treasons, and that the Puritan
      leaders, by taking this course, showed that they were regardless of the
      honour and independence of the nation, and anxious only for the success of
      their own faction. We are utterly unable to see any distinction between
      the case of the Scotch invasion in 1640, and the case of the Dutch
      invasion in 1688; or rather, we see distinctions which are to the
      advantage of Hampden and his friends. We believe Charles to have been a
      worse and more danserons king than his son. The Dutch were strangers to
      us, the Scots a kindred people speaking the same language, subjects of the
      same prince, not aliens in the eye of the law. If, indeed, it had been
      possible that a Scotch army or a Dutch army could have enslaved England,
      those who persuaded Leslie to cross the Tweed, and those who signed the
      invitation to the Prince of Orange, would have been traitors to their
      country. But such a result was out of the question. All that either a
      Scotch or a Dutch invasion could do was to give the public feeling of
      England an opportunity to show itself. Both expeditions would have ended
      in complete and ludicrous <span class="pagenum">466</span><a
      name="link466_rdquo_________id_" id="link466_rdquo_________id_"></a>discomfiture,
      had Charles and James been supported by their soldiers and their people.
      In neither case, therefore, was the independence of England endangered; in
      both cases her liberties were preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second campaign of Charles against the Scots was short and
      ignominious. His soldiers, as soon as they saw the enemy, ran away as
      English soldiers have never run either before or since. It can scarcely be
      doubted that their flight was the effect, not of cowardice, but of
      disaffection. The four northern counties of England were occupied by the
      Scotch army, and the King retired to York.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game of tyranny was now up. Charles had risked and lost his last
      stake. It is not easy to retrace the mortifications and humiliations which
      the tyrant now had to endure, without a feeling of vindictive pleasure.
      His army was munitions; his treasury was empty; his people clamoured for a
      Parliament; addresses and petitions against the government were presented.
      Strafford was for shooting the petitioners by martial law; but the King
      could not trust the soldiers. A great council of Peers was called at York;
      but the King could not trust even the Peers. He struggled, evaded,
      hesitated, tried every shift, rather than again face the representatives
      of his injured people. At length no shift was left. He made a truce with
      the Scots, and summoned a Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leaders of the popular party had, after the late dissolution, remained
      in London for the purpose of organizing a scheme of opposition to the
      court. They now exerted themselves to the utmost. Hampden, in particular,
      rode from county to county, exhorting the electors to give their votes to
      men worthy of their confidence. The great majority of the returns was on
      the side <span class="pagenum">467</span><a name="link467" id="link467"></a>of
      the Opposition. Hampden was himself chosen member both for Wendover and
      Buckinghamshire. He made his election to serve for the county.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third of November, 1640, a day to be long remembered, met that
      great Parliament, destined to every extreme of fortune, to empire and to
      servitude, to glory and to contempt; at one time the sovereign of its
      sovereign, at another time the servant of its servants. From the first day
      of meeting the attendance was great; and the aspect of the members was
      that of men not disposed to do the work negligently. The dissolution of
      the late Parliament had convinced most of them that half measures would no
      longer suffice. Clarendon tells us, that &ldquo;the same men who, six
      months before, were observed to be of very moderate tempers, and to wish
      that gentle remedies might be applied, talked now in another dialect both
      of kings and persons; and said that they must now be of another temper
      than they were the last Parliament.&rdquo; The debt of vengeance was
      swollen by all the usury which had been accumulating during many years;
      and payment was made to the full.
    </p>
    <p>
      This memorable crisis called forth parliamentary abilities such as England
      had never before seen. Among the most distinguished members of the House
      of Commons were Falkland, Hyde, Digby, young Harry Vane, Oliver St. John,
      Denzil Hollis, Nathaniel Fiennes. But two men exercised a paramount
      influence over the legislature and the country, Pym and Hampden; and, by
      the universal consent of friends and enemies, the first place belonged to
      Hampden.
    </p>
    <p>
      On occasions which required set speeches Pym generally took the lead.
      Hampden very seldom rose till late in a debate. His speaking was of that
      kind which <span class="pagenum">468</span><a name="link468" id="link468"></a>has,
      in every age, been held in the highest estimation by English Parliaments,
      ready, weighty, perspicuous, condensed. His perception of the feelings of
      the House was exquisite, his temper unalterably placid, his manner
      eminently courteous and gentlemanlike. &ldquo;Even with those,&rdquo; says
      Clarendon, &ldquo;who are able to preserve themselves from his infusions,
      and who discerned those opinions to be fixed in him with which they could
      not comply, he always left the character of an ingenious and conscientious
      person.&rdquo; His talents for business were as remarkable as his talents
      for debate. &ldquo;He was,&rdquo; says Clarendon, &ldquo;of an industry
      and vigilance not to be tired out or wearied by the most laborious, and of
      parts not to be imposed upon by the most subtle and sharp.&rdquo; Yet it
      was rather to his moral than to his intellectual qualities that he was
      indebted for the vast influence which he possessed. &ldquo;When this
      parliament began,&rdquo;&mdash;we again quote Clarendon,&mdash;&ldquo;the
      eyes of all men were fixed upon him, as their <i>patriae pater</i>, and
      the pilot that must steer the vessel through the tempests and rocks which
      threatened it. And I am persuaded his power and interest at that time were
      greater to do good or hurt than any man&rsquo;s in the kingdom, or than
      any man of his rank hath had in any time; for his reputation of honesty
      was universal, and his affections seemed so publicly guided, that no
      corrupt or private ends could bias them.. . . He was indeed a very wise
      man, and of great parts, and possessed with the most absolute spirit of
      popularity, and the most absolute faculties to govern the people, of any
      man I ever knew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is sufficient to recapitulate shortly the acts of the Long Parliament
      during its first session. Strafford and Laud were impeached and
      imprisoned. Strafford <span class="pagenum">469</span><a
      name="link469_rdquo_________id_" id="link469_rdquo_________id_"></a>was
      afterwards attainted by Bill, and executed. Lord Keeper Finch fled to
      Holland, Secretary Windebank to France. All those whom the King had,
      during the last twelve years, employed for the oppression of his people,
      from the servile judges who had pronounced in favour of the crown against
      Hampden, down to the sheriffs who had distrained for ship-money, and the
      custom-house officers who had levied tonnage and poundage, were summoned
      to answer for their conduct. The Star Chamber, the High Commission Court,
      the Council of York, were abolished. Those unfortunate victims of Laud
      who, after undergoing ignominious exposure and cruel manglings, had been
      sent to languish in distant prisons, were set at liberty, and conducted
      through London in triumphant procession. The King was compelled to give
      the judges patents for life or during good behaviour. He was deprived of
      those oppressive powers which were the last relics of the old feudal
      tenures. The Forest Courts and the Stannary Courts were reformed. It was
      provided that the Parliament then sitting should not be prorogued or
      dissolved without its own consent, and that a Parliament should be held at
      least once every three years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of these measures Lord Clarendon allows to have been most salutary;
      and few persons will, in our times, deny that, in the laws passed during
      this session, the good greatly preponderated over the evil. The abolition
      of those three hateful courts, the Northern Council, the Star Chamber, and
      the High Commission, would alone entitle the Long Parliament to the
      lasting gratitude of Englishmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proceeding against Strafford undoubtedly seems hard to people living
      in our days. It would probably have seemed merciful and moderate to people
      living in <span class="pagenum">470</span><a name="link470" id="link470"></a>the
      sixteenth century. It is curious to compare the trial of Charles&rsquo;s
      minister with the trial, if it can be so called, of Lord Seymour of
      Sudeley, in the blessed reign of Edward the Sixth. None of the great
      reformers of our Church doubted the propriety of passing an act of
      Parliament for cutting off Lord Seymour&rsquo;s head without a legal
      conviction. The pious Cranmer voted for that act; the pious Latimer
      preached for it; the pious Edward returned thanks for it; and all the
      pious Lords of the council together exhorted their victim to what they
      were pleased facetiously to call &ldquo;the quiet and patient suffering of
      justice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is not necessary to defend the proceedings against Strafford by any
      such comparison. They are justified, in our opinion, by that which alone
      justifies capital punishment or any punishment, by that which alone
      justifies war, by the public danger. That there is a certain amount of
      public danger which will justify a legislature in sentencing a man to
      death by retrospective law, few people, we suppose, will deny. Few people,
      for example, will deny that the French Convention was perfectly justified
      in placing Robespierre, St. Just, and Couthon under the ban of the law,
      without a trial. This proceeding differed from the proceeding against
      Strafford only in being much more rapid and violent. Strafford was fully
      heard. Robespierre was not suffered to defend himself. Was there, then, in
      the case of Strafford, a danger sufficient to justify an act of attainder?
      We believe that there was. We believe that the contest in which the
      Parliament was engaged against the King was a contest for the security of
      our property, for the liberty of our persons, for every thing which makes
      us to differ from the subjects of Don Miguel. We believe that the cause of
      the <span class="pagenum">471</span><a name="link471" id="link471"></a>Commons
      was such as justified them in resisting the King, in raising an army, in
      sending thousands of brave men to kill and to be killed. An act of
      attainder is surely not more a departure from the ordinary course of law
      than a civil war. An act of attainder produces much less suffering than a
      civil war. We are, therefore, unable to discover on what principle it can
      be maintained that a cause which justifies a civil war will not justify an
      act of attainder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many specious arguments have been urged against the retrospective law by
      which Strafford was condemned to death. But all these arguments proceed on
      the supposition that the crisis was an ordinary crisis. The attainder was,
      in truth, a revolutionary measure. It was part of a system of resistance
      which oppression had rendered necessary. It is as unjust to judge of the
      conduct pursued by the Long Parliament towards Strafford on ordinary
      principles, as it would have been to indict Fairfax for murder because he
      cut down a cornet at Naseby. From the day on which the Houses met, there
      was a war waged by them against the King, a war for all that they held
      dear, a war carried on at first by means of parliamentary forms, at last
      by physical force; and, as in the second stage of that war, so in the
      first, they were entitled to do many things which, in quiet times, would
      have been culpable.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must not omit to mention that those who were afterwards the most
      distinguished ornaments of the King&rsquo;s party supported the bill of
      attainder. It is almost certain that Hyde voted for it. It is quite
      certain that Falkland both voted and spoke for it. The opinion of Hampden,
      as far as it can be collected from a very obscure note of one of his
      speeches, seems to have been that the proceeding by Bill was unnecessary,
      <span class="pagenum">472</span><a name="link472" id="link472"></a>and
      that it would be a better course to obtain judgment on the impeachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this year the Court opened a negotiation with the leaders of the
      Opposition. The Earl of Bedford was invited to form an administration on
      popular principles. St. John was made solicitor-general. Hollis was to
      have been secretary of state, and Pym chancellor of the exchequer. The
      post of tutor to the Prince of Wales was designed for Hampden. The death
      of the Earl of Bedford prevented this arrangement from being carried into
      effect; and it may be doubted whether, even if that nobleman&rsquo;s life
      had been prolonged, Charles would ever have consented to surround himself
      with counsellors whom he could not but hate and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Clarendon admits that the conduct of Hampden during this year was
      mild and temperate, that he seemed disposed rather to soothe than to
      excite the public mind, and that, when violent and unreasonable motions
      were made by his followers, he generally left the House before the
      division, lest he should seem to give countenance to their extravagance.
      His temper was moderate. He sincerely loved peace. He felt also great fear
      lest too precipitate a movement should produce a reaction. The events
      which took place early in the next session clearly showed that this fear
      was not unfounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the autumn the Parliament adjourned for a few weeks. Before the
      recess, Hampden was despatched to Scotland by the House of Commons,
      nominally as a commissioner, to obtain security for a debt which the Scots
      had contracted during the late invasion; but in truth that he might keep
      watch over the King, who had now repaired to Edinburgh, for the <span
      class="pagenum">473</span><a name="link473" id="link473"></a>purpose of
      finally adjusting the points of difference which remained between him and
      his northern subjects. It was the business of Hampden to dissuade the
      Covenanters from making their peace with the Court, at the expense of the
      popular party in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the King was in Scotland, the Irish rebellion broke out. The
      suddenness and violence of this terrible explosion excited a strange
      suspicion in the public mind. The Queen was a professed Papist. The King
      and the Archbishop of Canterbury had not indeed been reconciled to the See
      of Rome; but they had, while acting towards the Puritan party with the
      utmost rigour, and speaking of that party with the utmost contempt, shown
      great tenderness and respect towards the Catholic religion and its
      professors. In spite of the wishes of successive Parliaments, the
      Protestant separatists had been cruelly persecuted. And at the same time,
      in spite of the wishes of those very Parliaments, laws which were in force
      against the Papists, and which, unjustifiable as they were, suited the
      temper of that age, had not been carried into execution. The Protestant
      nonconformists had not yet learned toleration in the school of suffering.
      They reprobated the partial lenity which the government showed towards
      idolaters, and, with some show of reason, ascribed to bad motives conduct
      which, in such a king as Charles, and such a prelate as Laud, could not
      possibly be ascribed to humanity or to liberality of sentiment. The
      violent Arminianism of the Archbishop, his childish attachment to
      ceremonies, his superstitious veneration for altars, vestments, and
      painted windows, his bigoted zeal for the constitution and the privileges
      of his order, his known opinions respecting the celibacy of the clergy,
      had excited great disgust <span class="pagenum">474</span><a
      name="link474_rdquo_________id_" id="link474_rdquo_________id_"></a>throughout
      that large party which was every day becoming more and more hostile to
      Rome, and more and more inclined to the doctrines and the discipline of
      Geneva. It was believed by many that the Irish rebellion had been secretly
      encouraged by the Court; and, when the Parliament met again in November,
      after a short recess, the Puritans were more intractable than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that which Hampden had feared had come to pass. A reaction had taken
      place. A large body of moderate and well-meaning men, who had heartily
      concurred in the strong measures adopted before the recess, were inclined
      to pause. Their opinion was that, during many years, the country had been
      grievously misgoverned, and that a great reform had been necessary; but
      that a great reform had been made, that the grievances of the nation had
      been fully redressed, that sufficient vengeance had been exacted for the
      past, that sufficient security had been provided for the future, and that
      it would, therefore, be both ungrateful and unwise to make any further
      attacks on the royal prerogative. In support of this opinion many
      plausible arguments have been used. But to all these arguments there is
      one short answer. The King could not be trusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of those who may be called the Constitutional Royalists were
      Falkland, Hyde, and Culpeper. All these eminent men had, during the former
      year, been in very decided opposition to the Court. In some of those very
      proceedings with which their admirers reproach Hampden, they had taken a
      more decided part than Hampden. They had all been concerned in the
      impeachment of Strafford. They had all, there is reason to believe, voted
      for the Bill of Attabuler. <span class="pagenum">475</span><a
      name="link475" id="link475"></a>Certainly none of them voted against it.
      They had all agreed to the act which made the consent of the Parliament
      necessary to a dissolution or prorogation. Hyde had been among the most
      active of those who attacked the Council of York. Falkland had voted for
      the exclusion of the bishops from the Upper House. They were now inclined
      to halt in the path of reform, perhaps to retrace a few of their steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      A direct collision soon took place between the two parties into which the
      House of Commons, lately at almost perfect unity with itself, was now
      divided. The opponents of the government moved that celebrated address to
      the King which is known by the name of the Grand Remonstrance. In this
      address all the oppressive acts of the preceding fifteen years were set
      forth with great energy of language; and, in conclusion, the King was
      entreated to employ no ministers in whom the Parliament could not confide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The debate on the Remonstrance was long and stormy. It commenced at nine
      in the morning of the twenty-first of November, and lasted till after
      midnight. The division showed that a great change had taken place in the
      temper of the House. Though many members had retired from exhaustion,
      three hundred voted; and the Remonstrance was carried by a majority of
      only nine. A violent debate followed, on the question whether the minority
      should be allowed to protest against this decision. The excitement was so
      great that several members were on the point of proceeding to personal
      violence. &ldquo;We had sheathed our swords in each other&rsquo;s bowels,&rdquo;
      says an eye-witness, &ldquo;had not the sagacity and great calmness of Mr.
      Hampden, by a short speech, prevented it.&rdquo; The House did not rise
      till two in the morning. <span class="pagenum">476</span><a name="link476"
      id="link476"></a>The situation of the Puritan leaders was now difficult
      and full of peril. The small majority which they still had might soon
      become a minority. Out of doors, their supporters in the higher and middle
      classes were beginning to fall off. There was a growing opinion that the
      King had been hardly used. The English are always inclined to side with a
      weak party which is in the wrong, rather than with a strong party which is
      in the right. This may be seen in all contests, from contests of boxers to
      contests of faction. Thus it was that a violent reaction took place in
      favour of Charles the Second against the Whigs in 1681. Thus it was that
      an equally violent reaction took place in favour of George the Third
      against the coalition in 1784. A similar reaction was beginning to take
      place during the second year of the Long Parliament. Some members of the
      Opposition &ldquo;had resumed,&rdquo; says Clarendon, &ldquo;their old
      resolution of leaving the kingdom.&rdquo; Oliver Cromwell openly declared
      that he and many others would have emigrated if they had been left in a
      minority on the question of the Remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles had now a last chance of regaining the affection of his people. If
      he could have resolved to give his confidence to the leaders of the
      moderate party in the House of Commons, and to regulate his proceedings by
      their advice, he might have been, not, indeed, as he had been, a despot,
      but the powerful and respected king of a free people. The nation might
      have enjoyed liberty and repose under a government with Falkland at its
      head, checked by a constitutional Opposition under the conduct of Hampden.
      It was not necessary that, in order to accomplish this happy end, the King
      should sacrifice any part of his lawful prerogative, or submit to any
      conditions inconsistent <span class="pagenum">477</span><a
      name="link477_rdquo_________id_" id="link477_rdquo_________id_"></a>with
      his dignity. It was necessary only that he should abstain from treachery,
      from violence, from gross breaches of the law. This was all that the
      nation was then disposed to require of him. And even this was too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a short time he seemed inclined to take a wise and temperate course.
      He resolved to make Falkland secretary of state, and Culpeper chancellor
      of the exchequer. He declared his intention of conferring in a short time
      some important office on Hyde. He assured these three persons that he
      would do nothing relating to the House of Commons without their joint
      advice, and that he would communicate all his designs to them in the most
      unreserved manner. This resolution, had he adhered to it, would have
      averted many years of blood and mourning. But &ldquo;in very few days,&rdquo;
      says Clarendon, &ldquo;he did fatally swerve from it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third of January 1642, without giving the slightest hint of his
      intention to those advisers whom he had solemnly promised to consult, he
      sent down the attorney-general to impeach Lord Kimbolton, Hampden, Pym,
      Hollis, and two other members of the House of Commons, at the bar of the
      Lords, on a charge of High Treason. It is difficult to find in the whole
      history of England such an instance of tyranny, perfidy, and folly. The
      most precious and ancient rights of the subject were violated by this act.
      The only way in which Hampden and Pym could legally be tried for treason
      at the suit of the King, was by a petty jury on a bill found by a grand
      jury. The attorney-general had no right to impeach them. The House of
      Lords had no right to try them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Commons refused to surrender their members. The Peers showed no
      inclination to usurp the unconstitutional <span class="pagenum">478</span><a
      name="link478" id="link478"></a>jurisdiction which the King attempted to
      force on them. A contest began, in which violence and weakness were on the
      one side, law and resolution on the other. Charles sent an officer to seal
      up the lodgings and trunks of the accused members. The Commons sent their
      sergeant to break the seals. The tyrant resolved to follow up one outrage
      by another. In making: the charge, he had struck at the institution of
      juries. In executing the arrest, he struck at the privileges of
      Parliament. He resolved to go to the House in person with an armed force,
      and there to seize the leaders of the Opposition, while engaged in the
      discharge of their parliamentary duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was his purpose? Is it possible to believe that he had no definite
      purpose, that he took the most important step of his whole reign without
      having for one moment considered what might be its effects? Is it possible
      to believe that he went merely for the purpose of making himself a
      laughing-stock, that he intended, if he had found the accused members, and
      if they had refused, as it was their right and duty to refuse, the
      submission which he illegally demanded, to leave the House without
      bringing them away? If we reject both these suppositions, we must believe,
      and we certainly do believe, that he went fully determined to carry his
      unlawful design into effect by violence, and, if necessary, to shed the
      blood of the chiefs of the Opposition on the very floor of the Parliament
      House. Lady Carlisle conveyed intelligence of the design to Pym. The five
      members had time to withdraw before the arrival of Charles. They left the
      House as he was entering New Palace Yard. He was accompanied by about two
      hundred halberdiers of his guard, and by many gentlemen of the Court armed
      <span class="pagenum">479</span><a name="link479" id="link479"></a>with
      swords. He walked up Westminster Hall. At the southern end of the Hall his
      attendants divided to the right and left, and formed a lane to the door of
      the House of Commons. He knocked, entered, darted a look towards the place
      which Pym usually occupied, and, seeing it empty, walked up to the table.
      The Speaker fell on his knee. The members rose and uncovered their heads
      in profound silence, and the King took his seat in the chair. He looked
      round the House. But the five members were nowhere to be seen. He
      interrogated the Speaker. The Speaker answered, that he was merely the
      organ of the House, and had neither eyes to see, nor tongue to speak, but
      according to their direction. The King muttered a few feeble sentences
      about his respect for the laws of the realm, and the privileges of
      Parliament, and retired. As he passed along the benches, several resolute
      voices called out audibly &ldquo;Privilege!&rdquo; He returned to
      Whitehall with his company of bravoes, who, while he was in the House, had
      been impatiently waiting in the lobby for the word, cocking their pistols,
      and crying &ldquo;Fall on.&rdquo; That night he put forth a proclamation,
      directing that the ports should be stopped, and that no person should, at
      his peril, venture to harbour the accused members.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hampden and his friends had taken refuge in Coleman Street. The city of
      London was indeed the fastness of public liberty, and was, in those times,
      a place of at least as much importance as Paris during the French
      Revolution. The city, properly so called, now consists in a great measure
      of immense warehouses and counting-houses, which are frequented by traders
      and their clerks during the day, and left in almost total solitude during
      the night. It was then closely inhabited <span class="pagenum">480</span><a
      name="link480" id="link480"></a>by three hundred thousand persons, to whom
      it was not merely a place of business, but a place of constant residence.
      This great capital had as complete a civil and military organization as if
      it had been an independent republic. Each citizen had his company; and the
      companies, which now seem to exist only for the sake of epicures and of
      antiquaries, were then formidable brotherhoods, the members of which were
      almost as closely bound together as the members of a Highland clan. How
      strong these artificial ties were, the numerous and valuable legacies
      anciently bequeathed by citizens to their corporations abundantly prove.
      The municipal offices were filled by the most opulent and respectable
      merchants of the kingdom. The pomp of the magistracy of the capital was
      inferior only to that which surrounded the person of the sovereign. The
      Londoners loved their city with that patriotic love which is found only in
      small communities, like those of ancient Greece, or like those which arose
      in Italy during the middle ages. The numbers, the intelligence, the wealth
      of the citizens, the democratical form of their local government, and
      their vicinity to the Court and to the Parliament, made them one of the
      most formidable bodies in the kingdom. Even as soldiers they were not to
      be despised. In an age in which war is a profession, there is something
      ludicrous in the idea of battalions composed of apprentices and
      shopkeepers, and officered by aldermen. But, in the early part of the
      seventeenth century, there was no standing army in the island; and the
      militia of the metropolis was not inferior in training to the militia of
      other places. A city which could furnish many thousands of armed men,
      abounding in natural courage, and not absolutely untinctured with military
      discipline, <span class="pagenum">481</span><a name="link481" id="link481"></a>was
      a formidable auxiliary in times of internal dissension. On several
      occasions during the civil war, the train-bands of London distinguished
      themselves highly; and at the battle of Newbury, in particular, they
      repelled the fiery onset of Rupert, and saved the army of the Parliament
      from destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people of this great city had long been thoroughly devoted to the
      national cause. Many of them had signed a protestation in which they
      declared their resolution to defend the privileges of Parliament. Their
      enthusiasm had, indeed, of late begun to cool. But the impeachment of the
      five members, and the insult offered to the House of Commons, inflamed
      them to fury. Their houses, their purses, their pikes, were at the command
      of the representatives of the nation. London was in arms all night. The
      next day the shops were closed; the streets were filled with immense
      crowds; the multitude pressed round the King&rsquo;s coach, and insulted
      him with opprobrious cries. The House of Commons, in the mean time,
      appointed a committee to sit in the city, for the purpose of inquiring
      into the circumstances of the late outrage. The members of the committee
      were welcomed by a deputation of the common council. Merchant Tailors&rsquo;
      Hall, Goldsmiths&rsquo; Hall, and Grocers&rsquo; Hall, were fitted up for
      their sittings. A guard of respectable citizens, duly relieved twice a
      day, was posted at their doors. The sheriffs were charged to watch over
      the safety of the accused members, and to escort them to and from the
      committee with every mark of honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      A violent and sudden revulsion of feeling, both in the House and out of
      it, was the effect of the late proceedings of the King. The Opposition
      regained in a few hours all the ascendency which it had lost. The <span
      class="pagenum">482</span><a name="link482" id="link482"></a>constitutional
      royalists were filled with shame and sorrow. They saw that they had been
      cruelly deceived by Charles. They saw that they were, unjustly, but not
      unreasonably, suspected by the nation. Clarendon distinctly says that they
      perfectly detested the counsels by which the King had been guided, and
      were so much displeased and dejected at the unfair manner in which he had
      treated them that they were inclined to retire from his service. During
      the debates on the breach of privilege, they preserved a melancholy
      silence. To this day, the advocates of Charles take care to say as little
      as they can about his visit to the House of Commons, and, when they cannot
      avoid mention of it, attribute to infatuation an act which, on any other
      supposition, they must admit to have been a frightful crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Commons, in a few days, openly defied the King, and ordered the
      accused members to attend in their places at Westminster and to resume
      their parliamentary duties. The citizens resolved to bring back the
      champions of liberty in triumph before the windows of Whitehall. Vast
      preparations were made both by land and water for this great festival.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King had remained in his palace, humbled, dismayed, and bewildered,
      &ldquo;feeling,&rdquo; says Clarendon, &ldquo;the trouble and agony which
      usually attend generous and magnanimous minds upon their having committed
      errors;&rdquo; feeling, we should say, the despicable repentance which
      attends the man who, having attempted to commit a crime, finds that he has
      only committed a folly. The populace hooted and shouted all day before the
      gates of the royal residence. The tyrant could not bear to see the triumph
      of those whom he had destined to the gallows and the quartering-block.
      <span class="pagenum">483</span><a name="link483" id="link483"></a>On the
      day preceding that which was fixed for their return, he fled, with a few
      attendants, from that palace which he was never to see again till he was
      led through it to the scaffold.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the eleventh of January, the Thames was covered with boats, and its
      shores with the gazing multitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armed vessels, decorated with streamers, were ranged in two lines from
      London Bridye to Westminster Hall. The members returned upon the river in
      a ship manned by sailors who had volunteered their services. The
      train-bands of the city, under the command of the sheriffs, marched along
      the Strand, attended by a vast crowd of spectators, to guard the avenues
      to the House of Commons; and thus, with shouts and loud discharges of
      ordnance, the accused patriots were brought back by the people whom they
      had served and for whom they had suffered. The restored members, as soon
      as they had entered the House, expressed, in the warmest terms, their
      gratitude to the citizens of London. The sheriffs were warmly thanked by
      the Speaker in the name of the Commons; and orders were given that a guard
      selected from the train-bands of the city, should attend daily to watch
      over the safety of the Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The excitement had not been confined to London. When intelligence of the
      danger to which Hampden was exposed reached Buckinghamshire, it excited
      the alarm and indignation of the people. Four thousand freeholders of that
      county, each of them wearing in his hat a copy of the protestation in
      favour of the privileges of Parliament, rode up to London to defend the
      person of their beloved representative. They came in a body to assure
      Parliament of their full resolution to defend its privileges. Their
      petition was <span class="pagenum">484</span><a name="link484" id="link484"></a>couched
      in the strongest terms. &ldquo;In respect,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;of
      that latter attempt upon the honourable House of Commons, we are now come
      to offer our service to that end, and resolved, in their just defence, to
      live and die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A great struggle was clearly at hand. Hampden had returned to Westminster
      much changed. His influence had hitherto been exerted rather to restrain
      than to animate the zeal of his party. But the treachery, the contempt of
      law, the thirst for blood, which the King had now shown, left no hope of a
      peaceable adjustment. It was clear that Charles must be either a puppet or
      a tyrant, that no obligation of law or of honour could bind him, and that
      the only way to make him harmless was to make him powerless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attack which the King had made on the five members was not merely
      irregular in manner. Even if the charges had been preferred legally, if
      the Grand Jury of Middlesex had found a true bill, if the accused persons
      had been arrested under a proper warrant and at a proper time and place,
      there would still have been in the proceeding enough of perfidy and
      injustice to vindicate the strongest measures which the Opposition could
      take. To Impeach Pym and Hampden was to impeach the House of Commons. It
      was notoriously on account of what they had done as members of that House
      that they were selected as objects of vengeance; and in what they had done
      as members of that House the majority had concurred. Most of the charges
      brought against them were common between them and the Parliament. They
      were accused, indeed, and it may be with reason, of encouraging the Scotch
      army to invade England. In doing this, they had committed what was, in
      strictness of law, a high offence, the <span class="pagenum">485</span><a
      name="link485" id="link485"></a>same offence which Devonshire and
      Shrewsbury committed in 1688. But the King had promised pardon and
      oblivion to those who had been the principals in the Scotch insurrection.
      Did it then consist with his honour to punish the accessaries? He had
      bestowed marks of his favour on the leading Covenanters. He had given the
      great seal of Scotland to one chief of the rebels, a marquisate to
      another, an earldom to Leslie, who had brought the Presbyterian army
      across the Tweed. On what principle was Hampden to be attainted for
      advising what Leslie was ennobled for doing? In a court of law, of course,
      no Englishman could plead an amnesty granted to the Scots. But, though not
      an illegal, it was surely an inconsistent and a most unkingly course,
      after pardoning and promoting the heads of the rebellion in one kingdom,
      to hang, draw, and quarter their accomplices in another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proceedings of the King against the five members, or rather against
      that. Parliament which had concurred in almost all the acts of the five
      members, was the cause of the civil war. It was plain that either Charles
      or the House of Commons must be stripped of all real power In the state.
      The best course which the Commons could have taken would perhaps have been
      to depose the King, as their ancestors had deposed Edward the Second and
      Richard the Second, and as their children afterwards deposed James. Had
      they done this, had they placed on the throne a prince whose character and
      whose situation would have been a pledge for his good conduct, they might
      safely have left to that prince all the old constitutional prerogatives of
      the Crown, the command of the armies of the state, the power of making
      peers, the power of appointing ministers, a veto on bills passed by the
      two Houses. <span class="pagenum">486</span><a name="link486" id="link486"></a>Such
      a prince, reigning by their choice, would have been under the necessity of
      acting in conformity with their wishes. But the public mind was not ripe
      for such a measure. There was no Duke of Lancaster, no Prince of Orange,
      no great and eminent person, near in blood to the throne, yet attached to
      the cause of the people. Charles was then to remain King; and it was
      therefore necessary that he should be king only in name. A William the
      Third, or a George the First, whose title to the crown was identical with
      the title of the people to their liberty, might safely be trusted with
      extensive powers. But new freedom could not exist in safety under the old
      tyrant. Since he was not to be deprived of the name of king, the only
      course which was left was to make him a mere trustee, nominally seised of
      prerogatives of which others had the use, a Grand Lama, a <i>Roi Fain√©ant</i>,
      a phantom resembling those Dagoberts and Childeberts who wore the badges
      of royalty, while Ebroin and Charles Martel held the real sovereignty of
      the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conditions which the Parliament propounded were hard, but, we are
      sure, not harder than those which even the Tories, in the Convention of
      1689, would have imposed on James, if it had been resolved that James
      should continue to be king. The chief condition was that the command of
      the militia and the conduct of the war in Ireland should be left to the
      Parliament. On this point was that great issue joined, whereof the two
      parties put themselves on God and on the Sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      We think, not only that the Commons were justified in demanding for
      themselves the power to dispose of the military force, but that it would
      have been absolute insanity in them to leave that force at the disposal of
      <span class="pagenum">487</span><a name="link487" id="link487"></a>the
      King. From the very beginning of his reign, it had evidently been his
      object to govern by an army. His third Parliament had complained, in the
      Petition of Right, of his fondness for martial law, and of the vexations
      manner in which he billeted his soldiers on the people. The wish nearest
      the heart of Strafford was, as his letters prove, that the revenue might
      be brought into such a state as would enable the King to keep a standing
      military establishment. In 1640, Charles had supported an army in the
      northern counties by lawless exactions. In 1641 he had engaged in an
      intrigue, the object of which was to bring that army to London for the
      purpose of overawing the Parliament. His late conduct had proved that, if
      he were suffered to retain even a small body-guard of his own creatures
      near his person, the Commons would be in danger of outrage, perhaps of
      massacre. The Houses were still deliberating under the protection of the
      militia of London. Could the command of the whole armed force of the realm
      have been, under these circumstances, safely confided to the King? Would
      it not have been frenzy in the Parliament to raise and pay an army of
      fifteen or twenty thousand men for the Irish war, and to give to Charles
      the absolute control of this army, and the power of selecting, promoting,
      and dismissing officers at his pleasure? Was it not probable that this
      army might become, what it is the nature of armies to become, what so many
      armies formed under much more favourable circumstances have become, what
      the army of the Roman republic became, what the army of the French
      republic became, an instrument of despotism? Was it not probable that the
      soldiers might forget that they were also citizens, and might be ready to
      serve their general against their <span class="pagenum">488</span><a
      name="link488" id="link488"></a>country? Was it not certain that, on the
      very first day on which Charles could venture to revoke his concessions,
      and to punish his opponents, he would establish an arbitrary government,
      and exact a bloody revenge?
    </p>
    <p>
      Our own times furnish a parallel case. Suppose that a revolution should
      take place in Spain, that the Constitution of Cadiz should be
      reestablished, that the Cortes should meet again, that the Spanish Prynnes
      and Burtons, who are now wandering in rags round Leicester Square, should
      be restored to their country. Ferdinand the Seventh would, in that case,
      of course repeat all the oaths and promises which he made in 1820, and
      broke in 1828. But would it not be madness in the Cortes, even if they
      were to leave him the name of King, to leave him more than the name? Would
      not all Europe scoff at them, if they were to permit him to assemble a
      large army for an expedition to America, to model that army at his
      pleasure, to put it under the command of officers chosen by himself?
      Should we not say that every member of the Constitutional party who might
      concur in such a measure would most richly deserve the fate which he would
      probably meet, the fate of Riego and of the Empecinado? We are not
      disposed to pay compliments to Ferdinand; nor do we conceive that we pay
      him any compliment, when we say that, of all sovereigns in history, he
      seems to us most to resemble, in some very important points, King Charles
      the First. Like Charles, he is pious after a certain fashion; like
      Charles, he has made large concessions to his people after a certain
      fashion. It is well for him that he has had to deal with men who bore very
      little resemblance to the English Puritans. <span class="pagenum">489</span><a
      name="link489" id="link489"></a>The Commons would have the power of the
      sword; the King would not part with it; and nothing remained but to try
      the chances of war. Charles still had a strong party in the country. His
      august office, his dignified manners, his solemn protestations that he
      would for the time to come respect the liberties of his subjects, pity for
      fallen greatness, fear of violent innovation, secured to him many
      adherents. He had with him the Church, the Universities, a majority of the
      nobles and of the old landed gentry. The austerity of the Puritan manners
      drove most of the gay and dissolute youth of that age to the royal
      standard. Many good, brave, and moderate men, who disliked his former
      conduct, and who entertained doubts touching his present sincerity,
      espoused his cause unwillingly and with many painful misgivings, because,
      though they dreaded his tyranny much, they dreaded democratic violence
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side was the great body of the middle orders of England, the
      merchants, the shopkeepers, the yeomanry, headed by a very large and
      formidable minority of the peerage and of the landed gentry. The Earl of
      Essex, a man of respectable abilities and of some military experience, was
      appointed to the command of the parliamentary army.
    </p>

      Hampden spared neither his fortune nor his person in the cause. He
      subscribed two thousand pounds to the public service. He took a colonel&rsquo;s
      commission in the army, and went into Buckinghamshire to raise a regiment
      of infantry. His neighbours eagerly enlisted under his command. His men
      were known by their green uniform, and by their standard, which bore on
      one side the watchword of the Parliament, &ldquo;God with us,&rdquo; and
      on the other the device of Hampden, &ldquo;Vestigia <span class="pagenum">490</span><a
      name="link490" id="link490"></a>nulla retrorsum.&rdquo; This motto well
      described the line of conduct which he pursued. No member of his party had
      been so temperate, while there remained a hope that legal and peaceable
      measures might save the country. No member of his party showed so much
      energy and vigour when it became necessary to appeal to arms. He made
      himself thoroughly master of his military duty, and &ldquo;performed it,&rdquo;
      to use the words of Clarendon, &ldquo;upon all occasions most punctually.&rdquo;
      The regiment which he had raised and trained was considered as one of the
      best in the service of the Parliament. He exposed his person in every
      action, with an intrepidity which made him conspicuous even among
      thousands of brave men. &ldquo;He was,&rdquo; says Clarendon, &ldquo;of a
      personal courage equal to his best parts; so that he was an enemy not to
      be wished wherever he might have been made a friend, and as much to be
      apprehended where he was so, as any man could deserve to be.&rdquo; Though
      his military career was short, and his military situation subordinate, he
      fully proved that he possessed the talents of a great general, as well as
      those of a great statesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall not attempt to give a history of the war. Lord Nugent&rsquo;s
      account of the military operations is very animated and striking. Our
      abstract would be dull, and probably unintelligible. There was, in fact,
      for some time no great and connected system of operations on either side.
      The war of the two parties was like the war of Arimanes and Oromasdes,
      neither of whom, according to the Eastern theologians, has any exclusive
      domain, who are equally omnipresent, who equally pervade all space, who
      carry on their eternal strife within every particle of matter. There was a
      petty war in almost every county. A town furnished <span class="pagenum">491</span><a
      name="link491" id="link491"></a>troops to the Parliament while the
      manor-house of the neighbouring peer was garrisoned for the King. The
      combatants were rarely disposed to march far from their own homes. It was
      reserved for Fairfax and Cromwell to terminate this desultory warfare, by
      moving one overwhelming force successively against all the scattered
      fragments of the royal party.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a remarkable circumstance that the officers who had studied tactics
      in what were considered as the best schools, under Vere in the
      Netherlands, and under Gustavus Adolphus in Germany, displayed far less
      skill than those commanders who had been bred to peaceful employments, and
      who never saw even a skirmish till the civil war broke out. An unlearned
      person might hence be inclined to suspect that the military art is no very
      profound mystery, that its principles are the principles of plain good
      sense, and that a quick eye, a cool head, and a stout heart, will do more
      to make a general than all the diagrams of Jomini. This, however, is
      certain, that Hampden showed himself a far better officer than Essex, and
      Cromwell than Leslie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The military errors of Essex were probably in some degree produced by
      political timidity. He was honestly, but not warmly, attached to the cause
      of the Parliament; and next to a great defeat he dreaded a great victory.
      Hampden, on the other hand, was for vigorous and decisive measures. When
      he drew the sword, as Clarendon has well said, he threw away the scabbard.
      He had shown that he knew better than any public man of his time how to
      value and how to practise moderation. But he knew that the essence of war
      is violence, and that moderation in war is imbecility. On several
      occasions, particularly during the operations <span class="pagenum">492</span><a
      name="link492" id="link492"></a>in the neighbourhood of Brentford, he
      remonstrated earnestly with Essex. Wherever he commanded separately, the
      boldness and rapidity of his movements presented a striking contrast to
      the sluggishness of his superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Parliament he possessed boundless influence. His employments
      towards the close of 1642 have been described by Denham in some lines
      which, though intended to be sarcastic, convey in truth the highest
      eulogy. Hampden is described in this satire as perpetually passing and
      repassing between the military station at Windsor and the House of Commons
      at Westminster, as overawing the general, and as giving law to that
      Parliament which knew no other law. It was at this time that he organised
      that celebrated association of counties, to which his party was
      principally indebted for its victory over the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early part of 1643, the shires lying in the neighbourhood of
      London, which were devoted to the cause of the Parliament, were
      incessantly annoyed by Rupert and his cavalry. Essex had extended his
      lines so far that almost every point was vulnerable. The young prince,
      who, though not a great general, was an active and enterprising partisan,
      frequently surprised posts, burned villages, swept away cattle, and was
      again at Oxford before a force sufficient to encounter him could be
      assembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The languid proceedings of Essex were loudly condemned by the troops. All
      the ardent and daring spirits in the parliamentary party were eager to
      have Hampden at their head. Had his life been prolonged, there is every
      reason to believe that the supreme command would have been intrusted to
      him. But it was decreed, that at this conjuncture, England should lose
      <span class="pagenum">493</span><a name="link493" id="link493"></a>the
      only man who united perfect disinterestedness to eminent talents, the only
      man who, being capable of gaining the victory for her, was incapable of
      abusing that victory when gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening of the seventeenth of June, Rupert darted out of Oxford
      with his cavalry on a predatory expedition. At three in the morning of the
      following day, he attacked and dispersed a few parliamentary soldiers who
      lay at Postcombe. He then flew to Chinnor, burned the village, killed or
      took all the troops who were quartered there, and prepared to hurry back
      with his booty and his prisoners to Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hampden had, on the preceding day, strongly represented to Essex the
      danger to which this part of the line was exposed. As soon as he received
      intelligence of Rupert&rsquo;s incursion, he sent off a horseman with a
      message to the General. The cavaliers, he said, could return only by
      Chiselhampton Bridge. A force ought to be instantly despatched in that
      direction for the purpose of intercepting them. In the mean time, he
      resolved to set out with all the cavalry that he could muster, for the
      purpose of impeding the march of the enemy till Essex could take measures
      for cutting off their retreat. A considerable body of horse and dragoons
      volunteered to follow him. He was not their commander. He did not even
      belong to their branch of the service. But &ldquo;he was,&rdquo; says Lord
      Clarendon, &ldquo;second to none but the General himself in the observance
      and application of all men.&rdquo; On the field of Chalgrove he came up
      with Rupert. A fierce skirmish ensued. In the first charge, Hampden was
      struck in the shoulder by two bullets, which broke the bone, and lodged in
      his body. The troops of the Parliament lost heart and gave way. Rupert,
      after pursuing them for <span class="pagenum">494</span><a name="link494"
      id="link494"></a>a short time, hastened to cross the bridge, and made his
      retreat unmolested to Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hampden, with his head drooping, and his hands leaning on his horse&rsquo;s
      neck, moved feebly out of the battle. The mansion which had been inhabited
      by his father-in-law, and from which in his youth he had carried home his
      bride Elizabeth, was in sight. There still remains an affecting tradition
      that he looked for a moment towards that beloved house, and made an effort
      to go thither to die. But the enemy lay in that direction. He turned his
      horse towards Thame, where he arrived almost fainting with agony. The
      surgeons dressed his wounds. But there was no hope. The pain which he
      suffered was most excruciating. But he endured it with admirable firmness
      and resignation. His first care was for his country. He wrote from his bed
      several letters to London concerning public affairs, and sent a last
      pressing message to the head-quarters, recommending that the dispersed
      forces should be concentrated. When his public duties were performed, he
      calmly prepared himself to die. He was attended by a clergyman of the
      Church of England, with whom he had lived in habits of intimacy, and by
      the chaplain of the Buckinghamshire Green-coats, Dr. Spurton, whom Baxter
      describes as a famous and excellent divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time before Hampden&rsquo;s death the sacrament was administered
      to him. He declared that, though he disliked the government of the Church
      of England, he yet agreed with that Church as to all essential matters of
      doctrine. His intellect remained unclouded. When all was nearly over, he
      lay murmuring faint prayers for himself, and for the cause in which he
      died. &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; he exclaimed, in the moment of the <span
      class="pagenum">495</span><a name="link495" id="link495"></a>last agony,
      &ldquo;receive my soul. O Lord, save my country. O Lord, be merciful to&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;
      In that broken ejaculation passed away his noble and fearless spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was buried in the parish church of Hampden. His soldiers, bareheaded,
      with reversed arms and muffled drums and colours, escorted his body to the
      grave, singing, as they marched, that lofty and melancholy psalm in which
      the fragility&rsquo; of human life is contrasted with the immutability of
      Him to whom a thousand years are as yesterday when it is passed, and as a
      watch in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of Hampden&rsquo;s death produced as great a consternation in his
      party, according to Clarendon, as if their whole army had been cut off.
      The journals of the time amply prove that the Parliament and all its
      friends were filled with grief and dismay. Lord Nugent has quoted a
      remarkable passage from the next Weekly Intelligencer. &ldquo;The loss of
      Colonel Hampden goeth near the heart of every man that loves the good of
      his king and country, and makes some conceive little content to be at the
      army now that he is gone. The memory of this deceased colonel is such,
      that in no age to come but it will more and more be held in honour and
      esteem; a man so religious, and of that prudence, judgment, temper,
      valour, and integrity, that he hath left few his like behind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had indeed left none his like behind him. There still remained, indeed,
      in his party, many acute intellects, many eloquent tongues, many brave and
      honest hearts. There still remained a rugged and clownish soldier, half
      fanatic, half buffoon, whose talents, discerned as yet only by one
      penetrating eye, were equal to all the highest duties of the soldier and
      the prince. <span class="pagenum">496</span><a name="link496" id="link496"></a>But
      in Hampden, and in Hampden alone, were united all the qualities which, at
      such a crisis, were necessary to save the state, the valour and energy of
      Cromwell, the discernment and eloquence of Vane, the humanity and
      moderation of Manchester, the stern integrity of Hale, the ardent public
      spirit of Sydney. Others might possess the qualities which were necessary
      to save the popular party in the crisis of danger; he alone had both the
      power and the inclination to restrain its excesses in the hour of triumph.
      Others could conquer; he alone could reconcile. A heart as bold as his
      brought up the cuirassiers who turned the tide of battle on Marston Moor.
      As skilful an eye as his watched the Scotch army descending from the
      heights over Dunbar. But it was when to the sullen tyranny of Laud and
      Charles had succeeded the fierce conflict of sects and factions, ambitious
      of ascendency and burning for revenge, it was when the vices and ignorance
      which the old tyranny had generated threatened the new freedom with
      destruction, that England missed the sobriety, the self-command, the
      perfect soundness of judgment, the perfect rectitude of intention, to
      which the history of revolutions furnishes no parallel, or furnishes a
      parallel in Washington alone.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
